## üéØ THE STRATEGY IN SIMPLE TERMS

**What We Learned:**
- 99% of your keywords don't convert (wasting money)
- ONE keyword converts at 33%: "luxury christmas wreath"
- That's 83x better than everything else!

**What We're Doing:**
1. **Stop the bleeding:** Pause all keywords that don't convert
2. **Double down on winners:** Increase bid on proven keyword from $3 to $5
3. **Clone the winner:** Add 6 similar luxury-focused keywords
4. **Block waste:** Add negative keywords to avoid wrong traffic

**Why This Works:**
- Your landing pages are already excellent ("Bespoke Designer" positioning)
- Luxury buyers are your audience (they convert!)
- Generic bargain-hunters aren't your customers (they don't convert)
- $25/day is enough budget to dominate the luxury keyword space

## üìä TRACKING VERIFICATION

**Please review:** `TRACKING-VERIFICATION-GUIDE.md`

**What I need to verify your Oct 29 setup:**

**From Google Ads:**
- Screenshot of Conversions ‚Üí Summary page
- Screenshot of main conversion action settings
- Do you see "Conversions" column in campaign/keywords?

**From GA4:**
- Screenshot of Events page (showing "purchase" as Key event)
- Screenshot of Google Ads Links (showing linked status)
- Screenshot of recent Ecommerce purchases (if any)

**Quick answers also work:**
- "Yes, I see purchase as key event in GA4"
- "Google Ads shows 2 conversions from luxury keyword"
- "Auto-tagging is enabled"
- etc.

**Why this matters:**
Since you updated tracking on Oct 29, we want to make sure:
1. Conversions are flowing from GA4 ‚Üí Google Ads
2. Auto-tagging is working (gclid in URLs)
3. No double-counting or conflicts
4. Settings are optimized (count=one, 30-day window, etc.)

## ‚ùì QUICK ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: Why only $25/day and not $35?**
A: Based on 3-month data, we found only ONE keyword converts well. Need to test variations before spending more. $25 is enough to dominate that niche.

**Q: Why pause keywords with good CTR?**
A: CTR doesn't matter if they don't convert. "Buy christmas wreath" had 13% CTR and 38 clicks but 0 sales. That's $42 wasted.

**Q: What if the new luxury keywords don't work?**
A: Then we pivot again! That's why Week 1 is critical. We'll know within 7 days which ones to keep.

**Q: When will we see results?**
A: First conversion possible within 3-7 days. Consistent results by Week 2-3. Full ROI by end of season.

**Q: Should we run Display or Shopping ads too?**
A: No. Focus beats breadth with limited budget. Master Search first, then expand later.

**Q: What about remarketing?**
A: Good idea for January after we build audience list. For now, focus on new customer acquisition.
