3. **CONVERSION TRACKING IS CRITICAL**
   - MUST install in Week 1
   - Cannot optimize without it
   - Top priority after budget increase

4. **FOCUS = POWER**
   - 100% resources on Christmas = better results

## üìû FINAL THOUGHTS

**The shift to Christmas-only focus is smart because:**
- ‚úÖ Maximizes revenue during peak season (60-70% of annual sales)
- ‚úÖ Allows aggressive budget when it matters most
- ‚úÖ Captures limited 10-week window effectively
- ‚úÖ Can still do year-round strategy in January
- ‚úÖ Better ROI by focusing resources on highest-intent shoppers

**Without this urgency:**
- ‚ùå Risk missing entire Christmas season
- ‚ùå Competitors capture Christmas market share
- ‚ùå Miss peak revenue opportunity
- ‚ùå Can't recover lost time after early December

**Bottom line:** Client made the right call to focus on Christmas. Now execute quickly!
