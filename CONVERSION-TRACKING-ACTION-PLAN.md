# üéØ CONVERSION TRACKING FIX - ACTION PLAN
## Beliefs in Wreaths - Clean Up & Optimize

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Must complete before campaign optimization  
**Time Required:** 1-2 hours  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

---

## üìä CURRENT SITUATION

### Problems Identified:
‚ùå **12+ conversion actions** (too many!)  
‚ùå **Duplicate purchase tracking** (counting same sale twice)  
‚ùå **Multiple "Needs attention" warnings**  
‚ùå **0 conversions on 8+ actions** (useless clutter)  
‚ùå **Not clear which conversion is PRIMARY**  

### Impact:
- Google can't optimize properly (too many signals)
- Conversion data is inaccurate (duplicates)
- Can't tell which keywords drive actual sales
- Wasting time managing unnecessary conversions

---

## ‚úÖ TARGET STATE (What We Want)

### Clean Setup:
‚úÖ **1 PRIMARY conversion:** Purchase (optimize bids for this)  
‚úÖ **2-3 SECONDARY conversions:** Add to Cart, Begin Checkout (track but don't optimize)  
‚úÖ **All others:** Removed or disabled  
‚úÖ **Clear data:** No duplicates, accurate counting  

### Benefits:
- Google knows exactly what to optimize for
- Accurate conversion reporting
- Better bid optimization
- Cleaner account, easier to manage

---

## üéØ ACTION PLAN - 3 PHASES

### PHASE 1: AUDIT & DECIDE (15 minutes) ‚ö° DO FIRST

**Goal:** Understand what you have and decide what to keep

#### Step 1.1: Export Current Conversion List
- [ ] Go to: Tools & Settings ‚Üí Conversions
- [ ] Take screenshots of all conversion actions
- [ ] Note which are PRIMARY vs SECONDARY
- [ ] Document conversion counts for each

#### Step 1.2: Identify Purchase Conversions (THE IMPORTANT ONES)
Currently you have 2 purchase tracking methods:

**Option A: Google Shopping App - Purchase**
- Conversions: 7.00
- Value: $940.00
- Source: Website (direct tag)
- Status: Needs attention
- Action: PRIMARY

**Option B: Beliefs in Wreaths Site (web) purchase**
- Conversions: 6.00
- Value: $912.50
- Source: Website (Google Analytics GA4)
- Status: No recent conversions
- Action: SECONDARY

**Decision Required:** Choose ONE as your PRIMARY purchase conversion

**‚úÖ RECOMMENDATION: Keep "Google Shopping App - Purchase" as PRIMARY**

**Why:**
- Already set as PRIMARY
- Direct tracking (not dependent on GA4)
- More conversions (7 vs 6)
- Higher value tracked

**Action:**
- [ ] Keep: Google Shopping App - Purchase (PRIMARY)
- [ ] Change: GA4 purchase to SECONDARY or REMOVE
- [ ] This prevents double-counting

---

### PHASE 2: CLEAN UP & SIMPLIFY (30 minutes)

**Goal:** Remove useless conversions, fix duplicates

#### Step 2.1: Handle Purchase Tracking (MOST IMPORTANT)

**A. Set Google Shopping App - Purchase as PRIMARY**
- [ ] Go to: Tools & Settings ‚Üí Conversions
- [ ] Click: "Google Shopping App - Purchase"
- [ ] Verify: Action optimisation = **PRIMARY**
- [ ] Verify: Count = **One** (not Every)
- [ ] Click: "Troubleshoot" button
- [ ] Follow any recommendations to fix "Needs attention"
- [ ] Save changes

**B. Handle GA4 Purchase Duplicate**
Choose one option:

**OPTION 1: Remove GA4 Purchase** (Recommended - simplest)
- [ ] Click: "Beliefs in Wreaths Site (web) purchase"
- [ ] Click: "Remove" or "Edit"
- [ ] Status: Change to "Removed"
- [ ] Reason: Duplicates Google Shopping App Purchase

**OPTION 2: Keep as Secondary** (If you want both sources)
- [ ] Click: "Beliefs in Wreaths Site (web) purchase"
- [ ] Action optimisation: Change to **SECONDARY**
- [ ] This way it won't affect bid optimization
- [ ] Note: You'll still see some double-counting in reports

---

#### Step 2.2: Fix Micro-Conversions (Keep as Secondary)

**These are useful to track but shouldn't drive bidding:**

**A. Add to Cart Conversions**

Currently have 2 - consolidate:
- [ ] **"Google Shopping App - Add To Cart"** (18 conv., $2,566)
  - Action optimisation: **SECONDARY**
  - Status: Fix "Needs attention" (click Troubleshoot)
  
- [ ] **"Shopping Cart"** (0 conversions)
  - Action: **REMOVE** (not working, duplicate)

**B. Begin Checkout Conversions**

Currently have 2 - consolidate:
- [ ] **"Google Shopping App - Begin Checkout"** (14 conv., $2,022)
  - Action optimisation: **SECONDARY**
  - Status: Fix "Needs attention" (click Troubleshoot)
  
- [ ] **"Contact Information"** (0 conversions)
  - Action: **REMOVE** (not working, duplicate)

---

#### Step 2.3: Remove Useless Conversions (Zero Value)

**Phone Call Conversions (All showing 0 conversions):**
- [ ] "Calls from Smart Campaign Ads" - **REMOVE**
- [ ] "Clicks to call" - **REMOVE**
- [ ] "Smart campaign ad clicks to call" - **REMOVE**
- [ ] "Smart campaign map clicks to call" - **REMOVE**

**Why remove:** 0 conversions in 3+ years = not working, cluttering account

---

#### Step 2.4: Handle Page View Conversions (Optional)

**High volume, zero value conversions:**
- [ ] "Google Shopping App - Page View" (16,652 conv., $0)
- [ ] "Google Shopping App - View Item" (1,352 conv., $0)
- [ ] "Google Shopping App - Search" (126 conv., $0)

**OPTION 1: Remove** (Recommended)
- Not useful for optimization
- Too high volume, dilutes important data
- Action: Remove all 3

**OPTION 2: Keep as Secondary**
- Action optimisation: **SECONDARY**
- Exclude from "Conversions" column (they'll show in "All conversions")
- Only if you want to see this data

**My Recommendation:** Remove them - focus on sales, not page views

---

#### Step 2.5: Handle Payment Info Conversion
- [ ] "Google Shopping App - Add Payment Info" (4 conv., $0)
  - Decision: Keep as SECONDARY or Remove
  - Recommendation: Keep as SECONDARY (indicates purchase intent)

---

### PHASE 3: VERIFY & TEST (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Confirm everything is working correctly

#### Step 3.1: Review Final Setup

After cleanup, you should see:

**PRIMARY Conversions (1):**
```
‚úÖ Google Shopping App - Purchase
   - Action optimisation: PRIMARY
   - Count: One
   - Status: Active (no warnings)
```

**SECONDARY Conversions (2-4):**
```
‚ö™ Google Shopping App - Add To Cart
   - Action optimisation: SECONDARY
   
‚ö™ Google Shopping App - Begin Checkout
   - Action optimisation: SECONDARY
   
‚ö™ Add Payment Info (optional)
   - Action optimisation: SECONDARY
```

**Removed (8-10):**
```
‚ùå Beliefs in Wreaths Site (web) purchase (duplicate)
‚ùå Shopping Cart (0 conv)
‚ùå Contact Information (0 conv)
‚ùå All phone call conversions (4 items, 0 conv)
‚ùå Page views (3 items, too many, not useful)
```

#### Step 3.2: Check Campaign Columns

- [ ] Go to: Campaigns view
- [ ] Columns ‚Üí Modify columns ‚Üí Conversions
- [ ] Verify "Conversions" column shows ONLY PRIMARY conversions
- [ ] Check "All conversions" column shows PRIMARY + SECONDARY
- [ ] Confirm numbers make sense (no crazy high numbers from page views)

#### Step 3.3: Test Purchase Tracking (CRITICAL)

**Do a test purchase:**
- [ ] Go to beliefsinwreaths.com.au
- [ ] Add item to cart
- [ ] Complete checkout (real purchase or test)
- [ ] Wait 3-24 hours
- [ ] Check Google Ads ‚Üí Conversions
- [ ] Verify +1 conversion appears in "Google Shopping App - Purchase"
- [ ] If it shows = **TRACKING WORKS!** ‚úÖ
- [ ] If it doesn't = See troubleshooting guide
