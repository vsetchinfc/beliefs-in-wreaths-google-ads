### **Ad Group 2: Christmas Table Decor (All Year Products)**
**Landing Page:** `www.beliefsinwreaths.com.au/christmas`

- "Artificial Xmas Arrangement" sounds cheap for luxury brand
- "Buy Luxury Christmas Wreath Australia" - Wrong product (should be centrepieces)

---

## üìù STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

### Step 1: Pause "All Year Products" Ad Group (5 min) ‚ö° DO FIRST

**Why:** Campaign is 100% focused on Christmas wreaths only.

1. Google Ads ‚Üí Campaigns ‚Üí "B-in-W [Search | Sales]"
2. Click **Ad Groups** tab
3. Find "All Year Products" ad group
4. Check the box next to it
5. Click **Edit** dropdown ‚Üí **Pause**
6. Confirm

**Result:** All table decor/centrepiece ads are now paused. Budget focuses on wreaths only.

---

### Step 2: Fix Christmas Wreaths Landing Page (15 min)

1. Google Ads ‚Üí Campaigns ‚Üí "B-in-W [Search | Sales]"
2. Click **Ads** tab
3. Filter: Ad Group = "Christmas Products"
4. Select all ads (check top box)
5. Click **Edit** dropdown ‚Üí **Change final URLs**
6. Enter: `https://beliefsinwreaths.com.au/collections/christmas-wreaths`
7. Click **Apply**

**Result:** All wreath ads now go to correct Shopify collection page.

---

### Step 3: Create New Wreath Ads (30-60 min total)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT LIMITATION:** Google Ads allows maximum **3 Responsive Search Ads per ad group**. Choose wisely!

**Recommendation:** Create all 3 ads at once using the formulas below. Each tests a different angle:
- Ad #1: Balanced quality focus (PRIMARY)
- Ad #2: Urgency & delivery focus
- Ad #3: Luxury & customization focus

**Note:** Since you can only have 3 ads, you cannot easily add more variations later without pausing an existing ad.

---

## üí° **WHAT ABOUT AD VARIATIONS?**

**Good news!** Google Ads has a separate feature called **"Ad Variations"** that lets you test changes to your existing ads **without counting against the 3-ad limit**.

### How Ad Variations Work:

**Ad Variations** is an A/B testing tool that:
- Creates temporary copies of your ads with specific changes
- Runs as an **experiment** alongside your original ads
- Tests things like: different headlines, descriptions, CTAs, or landing pages
- **Does NOT count against your 3 RSA limit** (it's a separate experiment feature)
- Shows you statistical results: which version performs better

### Where to Find It:
1. Google Ads ‚Üí Left menu ‚Üí **"Experiments"**
2. Click **"+ New experiment"**
3. Select **"Ad variations"**
4. Choose which ads to test
5. Specify what to change (headlines, descriptions, etc.)

---

## üß™ **AD VARIATIONS vs RESPONSIVE SEARCH ADS**

### **Responsive Search Ads (RSAs)** - What You're Creating Now:
- ‚úÖ Permanent ads in your ad group
- ‚úÖ Google automatically mixes & matches headlines/descriptions
- ‚úÖ Limited to **3 per ad group**
- ‚úÖ Run continuously
- ‚úÖ Best for: Testing completely different messaging strategies
- ‚ùå Hard to isolate what specific change made the difference

### **Ad Variations (Experiments)** - For Future Testing:
- ‚úÖ Temporary A/B tests (you set duration: 2-6 weeks)
- ‚úÖ Tests **one specific change** at a time
- ‚úÖ **Unlimited** - doesn't count against 3-ad limit
- ‚úÖ 50/50 traffic split between original and variation
- ‚úÖ Statistical significance calculations built-in
- ‚úÖ Best for: Testing specific elements (e.g., "Free Delivery" vs "Fast Shipping")
- ‚ùå Only tests one change at a time (more controlled but slower)

---

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED TESTING STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1: Create Your 3 Base RSAs (THIS WEEK)**
Create 3 different Responsive Search Ads with distinct strategies:
- Ad #1: Quality + Benefits (balanced)
- Ad #2: Urgency + Scarcity
- Ad #3: Luxury + Premium

**Timeline:** Today (60 minutes)  
**Goal:** Get 3 strong ads running with "Excellent" Ad Strength

---

### **Phase 2: Let Google Optimize (WEEKS 1-2)**
- Let all 3 ads run for 2 weeks
- Google will automatically test headline/description combinations
- Collect data: CTR, conversions, cost per conversion
- **Don't make changes yet** - let algorithm learn

**Timeline:** Oct 14-28, 2025  
**Goal:** Gather 100+ impressions per ad, identify best performer

---

### **Phase 3: Use Ad Variations for Fine-Tuning (WEEK 3+)**
Once you have a winning ad, use **Ad Variations** to test specific improvements:

**Example Ad Variation Tests:**

#### **Test #1: CTA Comparison**
- **Original:** "Order Now For Christmas"
- **Variation:** "Shop Now - Limited Stock"
- **Question:** Does urgency language increase CTR?

#### **Test #2: Value Proposition**
- **Original:** "Free Delivery Over $150"
- **Variation:** "Free Express Delivery Over $150"
- **Question:** Does "Express" increase conversions?

#### **Test #3: Description Focus**
- **Original:** "Handmade Australian wreaths. Custom designs, free delivery over $150. Order now!"
- **Variation:** "Premium Christmas wreaths. Australian handmade. Order today for Christmas delivery!"
- **Question:** Does emphasizing Christmas delivery beat free delivery message?

#### **Test #4: Landing Page**
- **Original Landing Page:** `/collections/christmas-wreaths` (all products)
- **Variation Landing Page:** `/products/luxury-christmas-wreath` (specific product)
- **Question:** Does sending to specific product page increase conversion rate?

   - Select **descriptions** if changing description text
   
   **Optional checkboxes:**

**üí° STEP 2 TIPS & EXAMPLES:**

### **Example 1: Changing a Headline CTA**
```
Find text: Order Now For Christmas
In: headlines
Replace with: Shop Now - Limited Stock
Match case: ‚òê Unchecked
Match whole words only: ‚òê Unchecked
```
**Result:** Tests urgency language impact on CTR

### **Example 2: Changing Delivery Message**
```
Find text: Free Delivery Over $150
In: headlines
Replace with: Free Express Delivery $150+
Match case: ‚òê Unchecked
Match whole words only: ‚òê Unchecked
```
**Result:** Tests whether "Express" increases perceived value

### **Example 3: Changing Description Focus**
```
Find text: Custom designs, free delivery over $150
In: descriptions
Replace with: Christmas delivery guaranteed, free over $150
Match case: ‚òê Unchecked
Match whole words only: ‚òê Unchecked
```
**Result:** Tests delivery guarantee vs customization messaging

### **Example 4: Changing Brand Positioning**
```
Find text: Handmade Christmas Wreaths
In: headlines
Replace with: Luxury Handmade Wreaths
Match case: ‚òê Unchecked
Match whole words only: ‚òê Unchecked
```
**Result:** Tests premium positioning

---

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES FOR STEP 2:**

### ‚úÖ DO:
- **Be specific** with your "Find text" - use exact phrasing from your ads
- **Test one element** at a time (one headline or one description)
- **Keep character limits** - Headlines ‚â§30, Descriptions ‚â§90
- **Preview results** before clicking Continue
- **Document what you're testing** for future reference

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Use partial words that might match unintended text
- Change multiple different headlines in one experiment
- Exceed character limits (Google will reject)
- Use "Match whole words only" if your text includes punctuation
- Forget to select correct field (headlines vs descriptions)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
‚ùå **Find text:** "Order Now" ‚Üí Too broad, might match "Order Now For Christmas" AND "Order Now Online"
‚úÖ **Find text:** "Order Now For Christmas" ‚Üí Specific, matches exactly what you want

‚ùå **Replace with:** "Shop Now - Limited Stock Left Before Christmas Day!" ‚Üí 55 chars, TOO LONG
‚úÖ **Replace with:** "Shop Now - Limited Stock" ‚Üí 24 chars, perfect

‚ùå **In:** descriptions (but the text is actually in headlines) ‚Üí No matches found
‚úÖ **In:** headlines (correct location) ‚Üí Matches found

---

11. **Name Your Experiment**
    - **Experiment name:** Example: "CTA Test - Order Now vs Shop Now"
    - **Description:** (Optional) "Testing urgency CTA to improve CTR"

14. **Set End Date**
    - **Recommended:** 2-4 weeks from start date

    - Example: If starting Oct 28, end Nov 11 (2 weeks) or Nov 25 (4 weeks)

15. **Choose Primary Metric**
    - Select what success looks like:
      - **Clicks** ‚Üê Choose this for CTR tests (headline/description changes)

**üìä MONITORING YOUR EXPERIMENT**

### **What Happens After You Create an Ad Variation?**

**Step 1: Creating Status (First Few Minutes)**
- Your experiment will show **Status: "Creating"** in the Ad variations tab
- Google is processing your variation and setting up the split test
- The table shows columns:
  - **Variation** - Your experiment name (e.g., "Shop vs Order")
  - **Status** - Current state (Creating ‚Üí Enabled ‚Üí Ended)
  - **Ad text changes** - What you're testing (e.g., "Find 'Order Now For Christmas' and replace with 'Shop Now - Limited Stock' in any headline")
  - **Actions** - Options menu (‚ãÆ)
  - **Affected ads** - How many ads are being tested
  - **Clicks** - Performance metric
  - **Impr.** (Impressions) - Performance metric
  - **CTR** - Click-through rate comparison
  - **Avg. CPC** - Cost per click comparison
- All metrics will show "0" initially until the experiment goes live

**Step 2: Enabled Status (Within 1-2 Hours)**
- Status changes to **"Enabled"** once Google activates the experiment
- Your ads will now start serving both versions (50/50 split)
- The experiment is officially running
- Data collection begins

**Step 3: Running Experiment (Next 2-4 Weeks)**
- Both original and variation ads serve to users
- Performance data accumulates
- Check back after 24 hours to see initial data:
  - Impressions count
  - Clicks count
  - CTR comparison
  - Early performance trends

---

17. **View Active Experiment**
   - Go to **Experiments** in left menu
   - Click on **"Ad variations"** tab
   - You'll see your experiment listed:
     - **Variation name:** "Shop vs Order" (or your chosen name)
     - **Status:** "Enabled" (when running)
     - **Ad text changes:** Description of what's being tested
     - **Affected ads:** Number shows how many ads contain the text being replaced
   - Click on experiment name to view detailed results

18. **Check Results (During Experiment)**
   - Click on your experiment name in the list
   - You'll see detailed comparison:
   
   **Original Version:**
   - Impressions
   - Clicks
   - CTR
   - Conversions
   - Cost per conversion
   - Average CPC
   
   **Variation Version:**
   - Same metrics as original
   - Shows performance difference (+/- %)
   
   **Statistical Indicator:**
   - Google shows confidence level
   - "Not enough data" ‚Üí Keep running
   - "Statistically significant" ‚Üí Clear winner found
   - "Inconclusive" ‚Üí Results too close
    
19. **Look for Statistical Significance**
   - Google will show an indicator when experiment reaches statistical significance
   - Usually need:
     - **100+ conversions per variation** (ideal)
     - OR **1,000+ clicks per variation** (minimum)
     - At least 2 weeks of data
   - If "Not enough data" appears, let it run longer

20. **After Experiment Ends**
   
   **Scenario A: Variation Wins (üéâ Better Performance)**
   - Status changes to **"Ended"**
   - Results show variation outperformed original
   - Example: "Variation CTR: 18.5% vs Original CTR: 13.4% (+38% improvement)"
   - Click **"Apply"** button to update your ads permanently
   - Google will automatically update the RSA with winning text
   - The variation becomes the new permanent ad
   
   **Scenario B: Original Wins (üòä No Change Needed)**
   - Results show original outperformed variation
   - Example: "Original CTR: 14.2% vs Variation CTR: 12.8% (-10%)"
   - Click **"End experiment"**
   - Keep your original ad as-is
   - Plan to test something different next time
   - Document the learning: "Shop Now" performed worse than "Order Now"
   
   **Scenario C: No Clear Winner (ü§î Inconclusive)**
   - Results are too close to call (difference <5%)
   - Example: "Original CTR: 13.5% vs Variation CTR: 13.8% (+2% not significant)"
   - Options:
      - **Extend experiment** (Actions menu ‚ãÆ ‚Üí "Extend" and add 2 more weeks)
      - **End experiment** and try a different, bigger change
      - Apply variation anyway if you prefer the messaging

**üéØ YOUR FIRST EXPERIMENT: "Shop vs Order"**

### **What You Just Created:**
- **Experiment name:** "Shop vs Order"
- **Find text:** "Order Now For Christmas"
- **Replace with:** "Shop Now - Limited Stock"
- **Testing:** CTA urgency language (Order vs Shop)
- **Hypothesis:** Scarcity language ("Limited Stock") will increase CTR

### **Next Steps for This Experiment:**

**Day 1 (Today - Oct 14):**
- ‚úÖ Experiment created (Status: "Creating")
- Wait 1-2 hours for status to change to "Enabled"
- Check that "Affected ads" shows the correct number (should be 1-3 ads)

**Day 2 (Tomorrow - Oct 15):**
- Check initial data
- Verify both versions are serving (impressions > 0 for both)
- Look for any errors or issues

**Week 1 (Oct 14-21):**
- Monitor daily for first few days
- Expected: 50-150 impressions total
- Expected: 7-20 clicks total
- Too early to judge winner yet

**Week 2-3 (Oct 21 - Nov 4):**
- Check weekly for trends
- Expected: 500-1,000+ impressions total
- Expected: 70-150+ clicks total
- Watch for "Statistical significance" indicator

**Week 4 (Nov 4-11):**
- Review results
- Make decision: Apply, Extend, or End
- Document learning for future tests

---

**üìä EXPECTED OUTCOMES FOR "Shop vs Order" TEST**

### **Possible Results:**

**Scenario 1: "Shop Now - Limited Stock" Wins**
- CTR improvement: +15-30%
- Why it won: Urgency + scarcity language creates FOMO
- Action: Apply to all ads
- Next test: Try "Get Yours Before Dec 15" for even more urgency

**Scenario 2: "Order Now For Christmas" Wins**
- CTR stays same or better
- Why it won: Clear action + holiday relevance more compelling
- Action: Keep original
- Next test: Try "Order Your Wreath Today" (simpler, more direct)

**Scenario 3: No Clear Winner**
- Difference <5%
- Why inconclusive: Both CTAs are similarly effective
- Action: Keep original (less risky), test something else
- Next test: Try completely different angle (e.g., "Free Delivery Over $150")

---## üí° **IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT NEW GOOGLE ADS UI**

### What's Different in the New UI:
- ‚úÖ Experiments are now under main left menu (easier to find)
- ‚úÖ "Custom experiment" replaces old "Ad variations" naming
- ‚úÖ Side-by-side preview of original vs variation during setup
- ‚úÖ Real-time statistical significance indicators
- ‚úÖ One-click "Apply" to implement winning variation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can only run **one experiment per ad group at a time**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need at least **1000 impressions per variation** for reliable results

### Common Issues:
‚ùå **"Cannot create experiment"** ‚Üí You already have an active experiment in that ad group. End it first.
‚ùå **"Not enough data"** ‚Üí Wait until you have 100+ conversions or 1000+ clicks per variation
‚ùå **"No statistical significance"** ‚Üí Extend experiment duration or test a bigger change

---

## üéØ **QUICK START: YOUR FIRST AD VARIATION**

### Recommended First Test (Week 3 - Oct 28):

**What to test:** CTA urgency language

**Original Ad #1 Headline:**
- "Order Now For Christmas"

**Variation Headline:**
- "Shop Now - Limited Stock"

**Hypothesis:**
- Urgency/scarcity language will increase CTR by 15-25%

**Setup Steps:**
1. Experiments ‚Üí Create custom experiment ‚Üí Ad variations
2. Select: Campaign "B-in-W [Search | Sales]", Ad Group "Christmas Products"
3. Choose: Your best-performing RSA (highest CTR after Week 1-2)
4. Replace: Headline "Order Now For Christmas" with "Shop Now - Limited Stock"
5. Keep: All other headlines/descriptions the same
6. Traffic: 50/50 split
7. Duration: 2 weeks (Oct 28 - Nov 11)
8. Primary metric: Clicks (to measure CTR impact)
9. Create and launch

**After 2 weeks:**
- Check which version won
- If variation wins: Apply to main ad
- If original wins: Keep as-is, test different CTA next

---

## üéØ **BEST PRACTICES FOR AD VARIATIONS**

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Test **one change at a time** (headlines OR descriptions OR landing page, not all)
- Run for **minimum 2 weeks** (4-6 weeks ideal for statistical significance)
- Need **100+ conversions** or **1,000+ clicks** for reliable results
- Test small changes (swapping 2-3 headlines, not entire ad rewrite)
- Document results in a spreadsheet (what you tested, winner, % improvement)
- Apply winning variations back to your main RSAs

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Change multiple things at once (can't tell what caused improvement)
- End experiment too early (<100 conversions or <1000 clicks)
- Run too many experiments simultaneously (splits traffic too thin)
- Forget to apply winning variations to your actual ads
- Test during unusual periods (Black Friday, website downtime, etc.)

---

## üìä **AD TESTING STRATEGY**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** With only 3 Responsive Search Ads allowed per ad group, Google will automatically optimize between them.

### How Google Handles Multiple Ads:
- **First 1-2 weeks:** Google tests all 3 ads equally to gather data
- **After 2 weeks:** Google starts showing best-performing ads more often
- **Ongoing:** Continuous optimization based on CTR and conversion rate
- **Your job:** Monitor performance, pause underperformers after 100+ impressions each

### Performance Monitoring Timeline:

**Week 1 (Oct 14-21):**
- All 3 ads serve with roughly equal impressions
- Google collects CTR and engagement data
- Don't make changes yet - let algorithm learn
- Verify all 3 ads show "Excellent" or "Good" Ad Strength

**Week 2-3 (Oct 21 - Nov 4):**
- Google starts favoring best-performing ads
- Check individual ad performance
- Compare CTR between ads (expect 10-20% difference)
- Identify which messaging resonates best

**Week 4+ (Nov 4 onwards):**
- Consider pausing lowest-performing ad (if CTR <10%)
- Create new variation to replace it
- Test new angles based on learnings

### What to Track for Each Ad:

| Metric | Ad #1 (Primary) | Ad #2 (Urgency) | Ad #3 (Luxury) |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Expected CTR** | 14-16% | 16-18% (highest) | 12-15% (lower) |
| **Expected Conv Rate** | 3-4% | 3-4% | 4-6% (highest) |
| **Expected AOV** | $100-120 | $90-110 | $140-180 (highest) |
| **Target Audience** | General | Urgent buyers | Premium buyers |

### Decision Rules (After 100+ Impressions Each):

**If Ad #2 (Urgency) has highest CTR:**
- ‚úÖ Keep Ad #2
- ‚úÖ Add more urgency elements to Ad #1
- ‚ùì Consider replacing Ad #3 with another urgency variation

**If Ad #3 (Luxury) has highest conversion rate:**
- ‚úÖ Keep Ad #3  
- ‚úÖ Increase focus on premium products
- ‚úÖ Consider raising prices
- ‚ùì Replace Ad #2 with another luxury angle

**If Ad #1 (Primary) is most balanced:**
- ‚úÖ Keep Ad #1 as control
- ‚úÖ Create variations testing individual elements
- ‚ùì Replace worst performer with refined version of Ad #1

### Replacing an Ad (When You Hit the 3-Ad Limit):

**Steps to Test New Variations:**
1. Identify lowest-performing ad (after 100+ impressions)
2. Click **"Pause"** on that ad (don't delete - you can reactivate later)
3. Create new ad variation with different angle
4. Run for 100+ impressions
5. Compare to remaining 2 ads
6. Keep best 3 performers active

**Ideas for Future Ad Variations (When Replacing):**
- Seasonal urgency: "Guaranteed Christmas Delivery by Dec 20"
- Social proof: "Australia's #1 Rated Christmas Wreaths"
- Gift angle: "Perfect Gift For Mum | Unique Christmas Wreaths"
- Local focus: "Australian Handmade | Support Local Artisans"
- Specific products: "LED Light-Up Wreaths | Free Delivery $150+"

---

~~OLD TESTING STRATEGY (Before knowing 3-ad limit):~~

~~### Week 1: Run Ad #1 Only (Primary)~~

---

## üö® **CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR ALL ADS**

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Leave all headlines and descriptions UNPINNED (critical for "Excellent" rating)
- Use unique headlines NOT on landing page
- Include brand name "Beliefs in Wreaths" in Headline 1 of every ad
- Mix features (With Lights), benefits (Easy to Hang), CTAs (Order Now)
- Keep headlines ‚â§30 chars, descriptions ‚â§90 chars
- Test different angles (quality vs urgency vs luxury)
- Use dynamic keyword insertion {KeyWord:} where appropriate

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Pin headlines or descriptions (kills Ad Strength - reduces from "Excellent" to "Poor")
- Duplicate landing page text in headlines
- Use generic headlines without value ("Shop Now", "Buy Online")
- Forget to include free delivery threshold ($150+)
- Create ads with <10 headlines (reduces Ad Strength to "Poor" or "Average")
- ~~Create all 3 ads at once~~ **ACTUALLY, DO create all 3 ads** (you're limited to 3 anyway!)
- Delete old ads immediately - pause them first to review performance data

---

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED CREATION SCHEDULE**

**‚ö†Ô∏è GOOGLE ADS LIMIT:** Only 3 Responsive Search Ads allowed per ad group

### ‚úÖ REVISED RECOMMENDATION: Create All 3 Ads Today

Since Google limits you to 3 RSAs per ad group, **create all 3 variations now** instead of staged rollout:

**Today (October 14, 2025) - 60 minutes total:**
1. **Ad #1** - Primary "Excellent" formula (30 min)
   - Balanced approach: quality + benefits + brand
   
2. **Ad #2** - Urgency & delivery focus (15 min)
   - Tests whether scarcity messaging improves CTR
   
3. **Ad #3** - Luxury & customization focus (15 min)
   - Tests whether premium positioning attracts higher-value customers

**Why Create All 3 Now:**
- ‚úÖ You're limited to 3 RSAs anyway (can't add more later)
- ‚úÖ Google will automatically optimize between the 3 ads
- ‚úÖ Gets A/B testing data immediately
- ‚úÖ More combinations for Google's algorithm to test
- ‚úÖ Better Ad Group performance with 3 ads vs 1 ad

**What Google Will Do:**
- Automatically show the best-performing ad more often
- Test different combinations for different searches
- Optimize based on CTR and conversion data
- You can see individual ad performance after 7-14 days

---

**Alternative Approach (If Time-Constrained):**

If you only have 30 minutes today:
1. ‚úÖ Create **Ad #1 only** (Primary formula) - 30 min
2. ‚è≥ Create **Ad #2 & #3** within next 2-3 days - 30 min

**But remember:** You can only have 3 total. If you want to test a new variation later, you'll need to pause/delete one of your existing ads.

---

~~OLD RECOMMENDATION (Before knowing 3-ad limit):~~

**Total Time Investment:**
- Ad #1: 30 minutes (DO NOW - highest priority)
- Ad #2: 15 minutes (DO NOW or within 2-3 days)
- Ad #3: 15 minutes (DO NOW or within 2-3 days)
- **Total: 60 minutes to create all 3 ads**

**‚ö†Ô∏è REMEMBER:** You can only have 3 Responsive Search Ads per ad group. To test new variations later, you'll need to pause one of these ads first.

```

**üéâ AD STRENGTH: EXCELLENT!**

**üîë KEY TO SUCCESS:**
1. ‚úÖ Removed all headline pins - Let Google's AI optimize combinations
2. ‚úÖ Used headlines NOT on landing page (avoid redundancy)
3. ‚úÖ Added brand name "Beliefs in Wreaths"
4. ‚úÖ Mix of Google's suggestions + your unique value props

**üí° Why Unpinning Worked:**
- Google's machine learning needs flexibility to test combinations
- Pinning limits testing to only 2-3 positions
- Without pins, Google can show the BEST headline combination for each search
- Result: Higher relevance = "Excellent" Ad Strength!
```
‚úÖ Headline 1: Beliefs in Wreaths (PIN to Position 1 - BRAND NAME)
‚úÖ Headline 2: Handmade Christmas Wreaths (PIN to Position 2)
‚úÖ Headline 3: Christmas Wreaths For Table (GOOGLE ADVISOR SUGGESTED)
‚úÖ Headline 4: Christmas Wreaths With Lights (GOOGLE ADVISOR SUGGESTED)
‚úÖ Headline 5: High Quality Products (GOOGLE ADVISOR SUGGESTED)

‚úÖ Headline 12: Order Your Christmas Wreath
‚úÖ Headline 13: Seasonal Christmas Decorations
‚úÖ Headline 14: Custom Door Wreaths
‚úÖ Headline 15: Order Now For Christmas
```

**ÔøΩ CRITICAL CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSION:**
- ‚ùå REMOVED: "Australian Christmas Wreaths", "Christmas Wreaths Australia", "Premium", "Luxury", "Buy Online", "Shop Unique", "Custom Christmas Wreaths", "Make Your Home Festive"
- ‚úÖ ADDED: Brand name + 7 unique benefit/feature headlines that DON'T appear on landing page
- ‚úÖ This should move Ad Strength from "Poor" ‚Üí "Good" or "Excellent"

**üí° Why Google Flagged Your Original Headlines:**
- They were too similar to text already on your landing page
- Google wants UNIQUE headlines that add NEW information
- Using your brand name is critical for brand recognition

**Enter Descriptions (do NOT pin - let Google optimize):**
```
Description 1:
‚úÖ Handmade Australian wreaths. Custom designs, free delivery over $150. Order now!

Description 2:
‚úÖ Premium Christmas Wreaths. For a Luxurious Holiday Season. (GOOGLE SUGGESTED)

Description 3:
‚úÖ Unique Christmas Wreaths: Handmade with Love in Australia (GOOGLE SUGGESTED)

Description 4:
‚úÖ Custom Christmas Wreaths: Design Your Own Unique Wreath (GOOGLE SUGGESTED)
```

**üéâ RESULT: Ad Strength = EXCELLENT!**

**üí° What Made It "Excellent":**
1. ‚úÖ **Unpinned all headlines and descriptions** - Google's AI can now optimize
2. ‚úÖ Headlines don't duplicate landing page content
3. ‚úÖ Included brand name "Beliefs in Wreaths"
4. ‚úÖ Mix of Google's suggestions + unique value props
5. ‚úÖ Variety: features (With Lights), benefits (Easy to Hang), emotional (Beautiful & Unique)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT LESSON LEARNED:**
- **Pinning reduces Ad Strength** - It limits Google's ability to test and optimize
- Only pin if you have a legal/regulatory requirement
- Let Google's machine learning find the best combinations for each search query

5. Repeat to create 2-3 variations (change pinned headlines)

## üìä EXPECTED RESULTS

### Week 1 (After Landing Page Fix):

- ‚úÖ Quality Score improvement: +1-2 points
- ‚úÖ Lower CPC: -15-20%

### Week 2-3 (After New Ads Launch):

- Highlight "Australian Made" / "Handmade"
- Emphasize "Custom" / "Personalisation"
- Include "Free Delivery Over $150"
- Use benefit-focused headlines
- Match ad copy to landing page content
- Test multiple variations

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Use "Xmas" (sounds cheap)
- Use "Artificial" (use "Premium" instead)
- Be too product-specific ("Peacock wreath")
- Send wrong products to wrong pages
- Forget to pin your strongest headlines

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. **Monitor Performance (Daily - Week 1)**
   - Check which new wreath ads get best CTR
   - Pause any underperformers after 50+ impressions
   - Increase bids on top performers
   - **Verify "All Year Products" stays paused**

2. **A/B Test Headlines (Week 2-3)**
   - Test "Luxury" vs "Premium" vs "Custom"
   - Test "Australia" vs "Australian Made"
   - Test emotional ("Make Your Home Festive") vs practical ("Free Delivery")
   - Test product-specific vs benefit-focused

3. **Optimize Based on Data (Week 4)**
   - Keep top 5 performing wreath ads
   - Pause bottom 50%
   - Create new variations of winners
   - Consider re-enabling "All Year Products" ONLY if wreath campaign is maxed out

## üìù IMPORTANT: ALL YEAR PRODUCTS AD GROUP

**Current Status:** PAUSED (as per Step 1)

**When to Re-enable:**
- ‚úÖ When Christmas wreath campaign is spending full $15/day budget consistently
- ‚úÖ When wreath Quality Scores are 7+ across all keywords
- ‚úÖ When you want to expand beyond wreaths
- ‚úÖ After Christmas season ends and you pivot to all-year products

**If You Re-enable Later:**
- Fix landing page to: `/collections/christmas-candle-holders-centrepieces`
- Remove all "Xmas" language, use "Christmas"
- Create new benefit-focused ads (not generic "Browse" headlines)
- Set separate daily budget or use shared budgets to control spend

**For Now:** Keep paused. Focus 100% on Christmas wreaths = better ROI.
