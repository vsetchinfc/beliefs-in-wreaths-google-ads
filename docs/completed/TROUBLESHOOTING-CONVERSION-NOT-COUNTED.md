# üö® TROUBLESHOOTING: Test Purchase Not Counted

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Issue:** Made test purchase, but no conversion recorded in Google Ads  
**Conversion:** Google Shopping App Purchase  

---

## üìã QUICK DIAGNOSIS CHECKLIST

Check these items in order:

### ‚úÖ 1. How Long Has It Been?
- [ ] **<3 hours:** WAIT - Conversions can take 3-24 hours to appear
- [ ] **3-24 hours:** Normal - Continue checking
- [ ] **>24 hours:** Problem - Continue troubleshooting below

**Action:** If less than 24 hours since purchase, wait before troubleshooting further.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Verify Conversion Settings

Looking at your screenshots, I see potential issues:

#### Issue A: Count Setting = "Every conversion"
**Current Setting:** Count = **Every conversion**  
**Should Be:** Count = **ONE** for purchases

**Why:** "Every conversion" means if someone purchases twice after one ad click, both count. For e-commerce purchases, you typically want "One" to count only the first purchase per click.

**Fix:**
1. Click on **Count** section to expand
2. Select **"One"** (recommended for purchases)
3. Click **Save**

---

#### Issue B: Value Setting Shows "$0" Default
**Current Setting:** "Use different values. If there's no value, use $0."  
**Concern:** If dynamic value isn't passing, conversions record as $0

**Check:**
1. Expand **Value** section
2. Verify: "Use different values for each conversion" is selected ‚úÖ
3. **Default value field:** Should be blank OR a realistic average (e.g., $150)
   - If it's $0, conversions might track but with no value

**Fix (if needed):**
1. Click **Value** to expand
2. In "Enter a default value" field, change from `0` to `150` (your average order)
3. This ensures if dynamic value fails, you still get some value data
4. Click **Save**

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Check Conversion Source & Tag

**Current Setting:** Source = **Website**

**This means:** Conversion tracked via Google tag on your website (not GA4 import)

#### Verify Tag is Installed:

**Step 1: Check Thank-You Page**
1. Go to order confirmation page URL (after completing purchase)
2. Right-click ‚Üí **View Page Source**
3. Press Ctrl+F and search for: `gtag`
4. Look for code like this:

```javascript
gtag('event', 'conversion', {
    'send_to': 'AW-XXXXXXXXX/AbC123',
    'value': 150.00,
    'currency': 'AUD',
    'transaction_id': ''
});
```

**If you DON'T see this code:**
‚ùå **Tag is not installed** ‚Üí This is your problem!

**If you DO see this code:**
‚úÖ **Tag is installed** ‚Üí Continue to Step 2

---

**Step 2: Verify Conversion ID Matches**

In the gtag code, look for the `send_to` value:
```javascript
'send_to': 'AW-XXXXXXXXX/AbC123'
```

**Get the correct ID from Google Ads:**
1. In your conversion settings, scroll to **"Tag setup"** section
2. Click **"View tag setup instructions"** or similar
3. You'll see the conversion tracking snippet
4. Compare the `AW-XXXXXXXXX/AbC123` part
5. They should match EXACTLY

**If they don't match:**
‚ùå **Wrong conversion ID** ‚Üí Update tag on website

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Test with Google Tag Assistant

**Most Reliable Test:**

1. Install **Google Tag Assistant** Chrome extension
2. Go to: https://beliefsinwreaths.com.au
3. Click Tag Assistant icon ‚Üí **Enable**
4. Refresh the page
5. Add item to cart ‚Üí Complete checkout
6. On thank-you/confirmation page ‚Üí Click Tag Assistant icon

**What You Should See:**
```
‚úÖ Google Ads Conversion Tracking
   Conversion ID: AW-XXXXXXXXX
   Conversion Label: AbC123xyz
   Status: Tag fired successfully
   Value: 150.00 (or your order amount)
   Currency: AUD
```

**What It Means:**
- ‚úÖ **Tag fired successfully:** Conversion is being sent to Google Ads
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Tag not found:** Conversion tag not installed on confirmation page
- üî¥ **Tag error:** Conversion tag has configuration problem

---

### ‚úÖ 5. Verify You're Checking the Right Place

**Where to Check Conversions:**

**Option A: Conversion Action Details**
1. Go to: **Goals** ‚Üí **Conversions** (left sidebar)
2. Find: **Google Shopping App Purchase**
3. Click on the name
4. Look at the performance graph
5. Change date range to **"Last 7 days"**
6. Should show spike on day of test purchase

**Option B: Campaign View**
1. Go to: **Campaigns** (left sidebar)
2. Find your campaign
3. Look at **"Conversions"** column
4. Should show +1 after test purchase appears

**Option C: Check "All Time" Date Range**
1. Make sure date range selector shows **"All time"** or includes test purchase date
2. Your screenshot shows: "31 July 2022 - 4 Oct 2025" ‚úÖ Good
3. If date range excludes today, you won't see the conversion!

## üîß MOST LIKELY CAUSES & FIXES

Based on your setup, here are the probable issues:

### Issue #1: Conversion Tag Not on Confirmation Page (80% likely)

**Symptom:** Tag Assistant shows "Tag not found" on order confirmation page

**Why:** 
- Shopify/website checkout redirects to external payment processor
- Tag only on product pages, not confirmation page
- Thank-you page is custom URL not tracked

**Fix:**
1. Identify your order confirmation page URL
   - Usually: `/thank-you`, `/order-confirmed`, `/checkout/thank_you`
2. Access website admin (Shopify, WordPress, etc.)
3. Find "Order status page" or "Thank you page" settings
4. Add Google Ads conversion tracking code there
5. Test again

**For Shopify Specifically:**
1. Shopify Admin ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Checkout**
2. Scroll to **Order status page** section
3. Paste conversion tracking code in **Additional scripts** box
4. **Save**

---

### Issue #2: Dynamic Value Not Passing (15% likely)

**Symptom:** 
- Tag fires successfully (Tag Assistant shows it)
- But conversion value shows as $0.00 in Google Ads
- Or conversions don't appear at all

**Why:**
- Conversion tag isn't receiving transaction value dynamically
- E-commerce platform not passing order amount to tag

**Fix:**

**Check Current Tag:**
```javascript
gtag('event', 'conversion', {
    'send_to': 'AW-XXXXXXXXX/AbC123',
    'value': 150.00,  // ‚Üê Is this static or dynamic?
    'currency': 'AUD',
    'transaction_id': ''
});
```

**If value is static (e.g., always 150.00):**
- Conversions will track, but all show same value
- Not ideal, but better than nothing

**If value should be dynamic:**
- Needs to use variable from e-commerce platform
- Example for Shopify: `{{ checkout.total_price }}`
- May need developer help

**Temporary Workaround:**
1. In Google Ads conversion settings
2. Set "Enter a default value" to your average order value (e.g., $150)
3. At least you'll get estimated value data

---

### Issue #3: Conversion Attributed to Wrong Source (3% likely)

**Symptom:**
- You made test purchase directly (not from ad click)
- Conversion tracked, but Google Ads doesn't count it

**Why:**
- Google Ads only counts conversions from people who clicked your ad
- Direct purchases (no ad click) don't appear in Google Ads reports
- But they DO appear in conversion action's total count

**Check:**
1. Did you click your own Google Ad before making test purchase?
2. If NO ‚Üí Conversion won't show in campaign reports
3. If YES ‚Üí Should show up (if tag works)

**Fix for Test:**
1. Search for your keywords on Google (use Incognito mode)
2. Click your own ad
3. Complete a purchase
4. Wait 3-24 hours
5. Check Google Ads

**Note:** You'll be charged for clicking your own ad!

---

### Issue #4: Conversion Window Too Short (1% likely)

**Your Settings:**
- Click-through conversion window: **90 days** ‚úÖ Good
- Engaged-view conversion window: **3 days** ‚úÖ Good
- View-through conversion window: **30 days** ‚úÖ Good

**This is NOT your problem** - windows are fine.

---

### Issue #5: Enhanced Conversions Issue (1% likely)

**Your Setting:** Enhanced conversions = **Managed through Google tag** ‚úÖ

This should be fine, but if you're NOT sending enhanced conversion data (email, phone, address), it might cause issues in some rare cases.

**Quick Check:**
- Enhanced conversions need customer data (email) hashed and sent
- If your tag doesn't include this, it's okay
- Enhanced conversions are optional (not required for basic tracking)
