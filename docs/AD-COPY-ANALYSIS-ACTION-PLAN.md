---

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS AFTER IMPLEMENTATION

1. **Monitor Performance (Daily - Week 1)**
   - Check which new wreath ads get best CTR
   - Pause any underperformers after 50+ impressions
   - Increase bids on top performers
   - **Verify "All Year Products" stays paused**

2. **A/B Test Headlines (Week 2-3)**
   - Test "Luxury" vs "Premium" vs "Custom"
   - Test "Australia" vs "Australian Made"
   - Test emotional ("Make Your Home Festive") vs practical ("Free Delivery")
   - Test product-specific vs benefit-focused

3. **Optimize Based on Data (Week 4)**
   - Keep top 5 performing wreath ads
   - Pause bottom 50%
   - Create new variations of winners
   - Consider re-enabling "All Year Products" ONLY if wreath campaign is maxed out

## üìù IMPORTANT: ALL YEAR PRODUCTS AD GROUP

**Current Status:** PAUSED (as per Step 1)

**When to Re-enable:**
- ‚úÖ When Christmas wreath campaign is spending full $15/day budget consistently
- ‚úÖ When wreath Quality Scores are 7+ across all keywords
- ‚úÖ When you want to expand beyond wreaths
- ‚úÖ After Christmas season ends and you pivot to all-year products

**If You Re-enable Later:**
- Fix landing page to: `/collections/christmas-candle-holders-centrepieces`
- Remove all "Xmas" language, use "Christmas"
- Create new benefit-focused ads (not generic "Browse" headlines)
- Set separate daily budget or use shared budgets to control spend

**For Now:** Keep paused. Focus 100% on Christmas wreaths = better ROI.
