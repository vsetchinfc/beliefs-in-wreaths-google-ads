## 🎯 What is the Search Terms Report?

The Search Terms Report shows the **actual search queries** people typed into Google before clicking your ads.

**Why it's valuable:**
- ✅ See what people REALLY searched for (vs your keywords)
- ✅ Find new keyword opportunities
- ✅ Identify wasted spend on irrelevant searches
- ✅ Add negative keywords to block bad traffic
- ✅ Understand customer language and intent

**Example:**
```
Your keyword: "christmas wreath"
Actual searches that triggered it:
  - "luxury christmas wreath" ✅ (good!)
  - "christmas wreath delivery sydney" ✅ (great!)
  - "diy christmas wreath tutorial" ❌ (waste! add negative)
  - "cheap christmas wreath" ❌ (wrong audience! add negative)
```

4. Focus on top 20 search terms

### Step 2: Identify Opportunities

**Look for:**
- ✅ High CTR (>8%) + conversions = **Add as keyword**

```

### Step 3: Identify Waste

**Look for:**
- ❌ Clicks but 0 conversions + irrelevant
- ❌ DIY, cheap, free, funeral terms
- ❌ Anything not related to Christmas wreaths

**Example:**
```
"diy christmas wreath tutorial" - 12 clicks, $8.40 spent, 0 conversions
"cheap christmas decorations" - 8 clicks, $5.20 spent, 0 conversions

→ WASTE: $13.60 on non-buyers
→ ACTION: Add as negative keywords immediately
```

### Step 4: Calculate Wasted Spend

1. Sort by: **Cost (descending)**
2. Identify irrelevant searches
3. Add up their cost
