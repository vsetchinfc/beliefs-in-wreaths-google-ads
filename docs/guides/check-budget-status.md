## 🎯 What is Budget Status?

Budget status tells you:
- ✅ Is your daily budget spending fully?
- ⚠️ Is your campaign "limited by budget"?
- 📊 What time of day does budget run out?
- 💸 How much you've spent vs. budget

**Why it matters:**
```
If budget limited: You're missing opportunities → Need to optimize or increase budget
If spending only 50%: Ads aren't competitive → Need to increase bids
If perfect: Budget lasts most of day → Well optimized!
```

## 📋 METHOD 1: Quick Status Check (30 seconds)

### Step 1: Go to Campaigns Overview

1. **Log into Google Ads** (ads.google.com)
2. Click **"Campaigns"** in left sidebar

### Step 2: Look for Status Icons

**In the "Status" column, look for:**

✅ **"Eligible"** = Good! Campaign is running normally

⚠️ **"Limited by budget"** = WARNING! Missing opportunities
```
→ Your budget is too low for your bids

```

```

#### Step 1: Go to Recommendations

1. **Left sidebar** → Click **"Recommendations"**

**Google will show:**
```
"Your budget has limited your ads from showing"
- Days affected: 8 out of last 14 days
- Potential clicks lost: ~50 clicks
- Estimated cost: +$15/day needed
```

**Decision:**
- If limited 1-2 days/week → Acceptable
- If limited 5-7 days/week → Need optimization or increase
- If limited every day → Definitely need to act

## 🎯 What Different Statuses Mean

### ✅ "Eligible" (No Budget Mention)

**Meaning:**
- Campaign running smoothly
- Budget is adequate for your bids
- Ads showing throughout the day

**Action:**
- Keep monitoring
- Continue optimizing
- Can potentially increase bids slightly

---

### ⚠️ "Limited by budget"

**Meaning:**
- Your $20/day is too low for your keyword bids
- Google is rationing your impressions
- You're missing potential clicks/sales
- Ads stop showing early in the day

**Why it happens:**
```
Example:
- Your bids: $0.50-$1.50 per click
- Potential daily clicks at full visibility: 40-50 clicks
- Cost of 40 clicks at $0.70 avg: $28/day
- Your budget: $20/day
- Result: Google shows ads ~70% of time
```

**Solutions (pick one):**

**Option A: Optimize (No extra cost)**
1. Lower bids by 20-30% on underperforming keywords
2. Pause keywords with 0 conversions
3. Add negative keywords to stop waste
4. Focus budget on winners only
5. **Result:** Budget lasts longer, better efficiency

**Option B: Increase Budget**
1. Increase to $25-30/day
2. **Result:** More visibility, more clicks, more sales
3. **Risk:** Higher investment

**Option C: Ad Schedule (Smart compromise)**
1. Pause ads midnight-6am (dead hours)
2. Concentrate budget on active hours
3. **Result:** Same $20 budget, better timing
4. **Benefit:** No extra cost, better efficiency

---

### 🔴 "Eligible (Learning)"

**Meaning:**
- Campaign is in learning phase
- Google optimizing delivery
- Need 7-10 days for stable performance

**When it happens:**
- New campaign launched
- Major bid changes
- Budget increased significantly
- New keywords added

**Action:**
- Be patient
- Don't make major changes for 7 days
- Let it stabilize
- Monitor but don't panic

---

## 📊 Ideal Budget Status Pattern

### What "Healthy" Looks Like:

**Daily Pattern:**
```
6am-9am: Ramping up (light spend)
9am-12pm: Active (moderate spend)
12pm-3pm: Steady (light spend) 
3pm-6pm: Active (moderate spend)
6pm-9pm: PEAK (heavy spend)
9pm-12am: Winding down (light spend)
```

**Budget usage:**
```
By 12pm: ~30% spent ($6 of $20)
By 3pm: ~50% spent ($10 of $20)
By 6pm: ~70% spent ($14 of $20)
By 9pm: ~95% spent ($19 of $20)
By midnight: 100% spent ($20)
```

**Status:**
- "Eligible" most of the day
- Maybe "Limited by budget" 9-11pm (acceptable)
- Covering all peak shopping hours

---

## 🚨 Problem Patterns to Watch For

### ❌ Pattern 1: Budget Gone by 2pm

**What it looks like:**
```
6am-12pm: Heavy spend
12pm-2pm: Budget exhausted
2pm-midnight: No ads showing
```

**Problem:**
- Missing evening shoppers (prime time!)
- Wasting budget on low-conversion morning hours
- Need immediate optimization

**Fix:**
1. Check search terms report (add negatives)
2. Lower bids on non-converting keywords
3. Implement ad schedule (pause 12am-6am)
4. Consider increasing budget to $25/day

---

### ⚠️ Pattern 2: Only Spending 50-70%

**What it looks like:**
```
Budget: $20/day
Actual spend: $12-14/day
Status: "Eligible" but underspending
```

**Problem:**
- Bids too low
- Keywords not competitive
- Missing opportunities
- Quality Scores low

**Fix:**
1. Increase bids on top performers by 20-30%
2. Check impression share (likely <30%)
3. Review Quality Scores (improve if <6)
4. Add more high-intent keywords

---

### 🔴 Pattern 3: Constantly Limited

**What it looks like:**
```
"Limited by budget" 7 days/week
Budget exhausted by 10am-12pm daily
Status: Red warning every day
```

**Problem:**
- Budget WAY too low for your strategy
- Either optimize aggressively OR increase budget
- Can't continue like this

**Fix (choose path):**

**Path A: Aggressive Optimization**
- Pause 50% of keywords (keep only converters)
- Lower all bids by 40%
- Add 20-30 negative keywords
- Focus on proven winners only

**Path B: Increase Budget**
- Increase to $30-40/day
- Scale what's working
- More aggressive approach
