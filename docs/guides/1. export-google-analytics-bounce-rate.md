# How to Get Bounce Rate & Engagement Data from Google Analytics 4

## Purpose
This guide shows you how to extract bounce rate, session duration, and engagement metrics from Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to diagnose why visitors aren't converting on your landing pages.

---

## What You'll Get
- **Bounce rate** - % of visitors who leave without interacting
- **Average engagement time** - How long people actually stay on pages
- **Pages per session** - How many pages visitors view
- **Sessions by landing page** - Which pages people enter on
- **Engagement rate** - % of engaged sessions (stayed >10 seconds OR viewed 2+ pages OR converted)

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access Google Analytics 4

1. Go to [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com)
2. Select your **Beliefs in Wreaths** property (usually shows as "beliefsinwreaths.com.au")
3. Make sure you're in the correct property (check top-left corner)

---

### Step 2: Navigate to Landing Page Report

1. In the left sidebar, click **Reports**
2. Click **Engagement** (in the Reports menu)
3. Click **Landing page**

**Alternative path if you don't see "Landing page":**
- Click **Reports** ‚Üí **Engagement** ‚Üí **Pages and screens**
- Then use the dropdown at top to switch from "Page path and screen class" to **"Landing page"**

---

### Step 3: Set the Date Range

1. Look for the date picker in the **top-right corner** of the report
2. Click the date range (it might say "Last 7 days" or "Last 28 days")
3. Select **Custom** from the dropdown
4. Set dates: **September 1, 2025** to **October 22, 2025**
5. Click **Apply**

**Why this date range?** This matches your Google Ads campaign data (Sept 1 - Oct 22) so we can compare traffic sources and behavior.

---

### Step 4: Customize Columns to Show What We Need

By default, GA4 doesn't show all metrics. You need to customize the table.

1. Look for a **pencil icon** (‚úèÔ∏è) or **customize report** button in the top-right area
2. Click it to open the customization panel
3. In the **Metrics** section, make sure these are selected:

**Essential Metrics to Include:**
- ‚úÖ Sessions
- ‚úÖ Engaged sessions
- ‚úÖ Engagement rate
- ‚úÖ Average engagement time
- ‚úÖ Bounce rate (if available - GA4 calls this "not engaged sessions")
- ‚úÖ Conversions
- ‚úÖ Total revenue (if e-commerce tracking is enabled)
- ‚úÖ Event count
- ‚úÖ Views

**How to add metrics:**
1. Click **"Add metric"** or the **+ button**
2. Search for the metric name (e.g., "bounce rate" or "engagement time")
3. Click the checkbox to add it
4. Repeat for all needed metrics

4. Click **Apply** or **Save** when done

---

### Step 5: Identify Your Key Landing Pages

Look for these specific landing page paths in the report:

- `/collections/christmas-wreaths`
- `/christmas-collection`
- `/christmas-candle-holders-centrepieces`
- `/` (homepage - if people are landing there)

**What you're looking for:**
- Which landing page gets the most sessions from Google Ads?
- Which one has the worst engagement rate or bounce rate?
- Which has the shortest average engagement time?

---

### Step 6: Filter for Google Ads Traffic ONLY

To see data specifically from your Google Ads campaign (not all traffic):

1. Look for **"Add filter"** or a **filter icon** (funnel shape) near the top
2. Click it to add a filter
3. Set filter:
   - **Dimension:** Session source / medium (or "Session default channel group")
   - **Match type:** Contains (or "Exactly matches")
   - **Value:** `google / cpc` (this is Google Ads traffic)
   
4. Click **Apply**

**Now you'll see ONLY Google Ads visitors**, which is what we need to diagnose the conversion problem.

---

### Step 7: Export the Data

1. Look for an **Export** button (usually top-right, might be a download icon üì•)
2. Click it and select:
   - **Download as PDF** (for quick viewing)
   - **Download as CSV** (for detailed analysis - RECOMMENDED)
   - **Google Sheets** (if you want to work in a spreadsheet)

3. Choose **CSV** format
4. Download the file
5. Save it somewhere you can find it (e.g., Desktop or `data/` folder)

**What to name the file:**
`ga4-landing-pages-sept1-oct22-google-ads.csv`

---

### Step 8: Take a Screenshot (Alternative to Export)

If export isn't working or you want a quick visual:

1. Make sure the table is showing all your key landing pages
2. Make sure columns show: Sessions, Engagement rate, Avg engagement time, Bounce rate
3. Press **Windows Key + Shift + S** to open Snipping Tool
4. Select the entire report table
5. Save the screenshot as `ga4-landing-pages-report.png`

## What the Metrics Mean

### Bounce Rate (or "Not Engaged Sessions")
- **High bounce rate (70%+)** = People are leaving immediately
- **Possible causes:** Slow load time, price shock, wrong audience, mobile UX issues
- **Good bounce rate:** 40-60% for e-commerce

### Average Engagement Time
- **Less than 30 seconds** = Red flag - people aren't reading or exploring
- **Your current:** 43 seconds max (you mentioned) - borderline low
- **Good engagement time:** 90+ seconds for product pages

### Engagement Rate
- **Low engagement (<40%)** = Most visitors don't interact meaningfully
- **Good engagement:** 60%+ for e-commerce
- **What counts as "engaged":** Stayed 10+ seconds OR viewed 2+ pages OR triggered an event

### Pages Per Session
- **Less than 2 pages** = Visitors aren't exploring your catalog
- **Good for e-commerce:** 3-5+ pages (people browsing multiple products)

## Quick Analysis Framework

Once you have the data, answer these questions:

### Question 1: Which landing page has the worst engagement?
- If `/collections/christmas-wreaths` has 80% bounce rate but `/christmas-collection` has 45%, we know where to focus fixes.

### Question 2: Is mobile vs desktop different?
- You'll need to create a secondary dimension for "Device category" to see this
- If mobile has 90% bounce but desktop has 50%, it's a mobile UX/speed problem

### Question 3: How does engagement time compare to clicks?
- **876 clicks from Google Ads** (we know this from Ads data)
- If average engagement time is 20-30 seconds = price shock or immediate disinterest
- If average engagement time is 2-3 minutes = people are interested but something blocks purchase

### Question 4: Are people viewing multiple pages?
- If pages per session is 1.2 = they land and leave
- If pages per session is 3.5 = they're browsing but not buying (different problem)

## Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem: "I don't see 'Bounce Rate' metric"
**Solution:** GA4 replaced "Bounce Rate" with "Engagement Rate"
- Bounce rate ‚âà 100% - Engagement rate
- Example: 35% engagement rate = ~65% bounce rate

### Problem: "Landing page report is empty"
**Solution:** Check these:
1. Date range is correct (Sept 1 - Oct 22)
2. Property is correct (beliefsinwreaths.com.au)
3. GA4 is actually receiving data (check Realtime report while visiting your site)

### Problem: "Numbers seem too low"
**Solution:** You might have a filter active
- Remove all filters except "Session source / medium = google / cpc"
- Check if you accidentally filtered to a specific landing page only

### Problem: "Export button is grayed out"
**Solution:** 
- You might not have export permissions (ask account owner)
- Try the screenshot method instead
- Or try "Share report" ‚Üí "Download file"

## What to Send to Agent

After you export the data, provide:

### Option A: CSV File (Best)
Upload or share the CSV file: `ga4-landing-pages-sept1-oct22-google-ads.csv`

### Option B: Screenshot (Quick)
Take screenshot showing the table with these columns visible:
- Landing page
- Sessions
- Engagement rate
- Average engagement time
- Bounce rate (or Engaged sessions %)
- Conversions

### Option C: Manual Summary (If exports fail)
Type out the data for your 3 main landing pages:

```
/collections/christmas-wreaths
- Sessions: [number]
- Engagement rate: [%]
- Avg engagement time: [seconds or minutes]
- Bounce rate: [%]
- Conversions: [number]

/christmas-collection
- Sessions: [number]
- Engagement rate: [%]
- Avg engagement time: [seconds or minutes]
- Bounce rate: [%]
- Conversions: [number]

/christmas-candle-holders-centrepieces
- Sessions: [number]
- Engagement rate: [%]
- Avg engagement time: [seconds or minutes]
- Bounce rate: [%]
- Conversions: [number]
```

## Next Steps After You Have the Data

Once you provide the GA4 landing page data, we'll be able to:

1. **Identify the worst-performing landing page** (lowest engagement, highest bounce)
2. **Compare Google Ads traffic vs organic traffic** (to see if it's an audience match problem)
3. **Determine if it's a speed issue** (immediate bounces) or content issue (quick visits but some exploration)
4. **Create a targeted landing page optimization plan** with specific fixes for your exact problem

---

## Expected Timeline

- **Time to complete:** 10-15 minutes
- **When to do it:** Today (Oct 22) or tomorrow morning (Oct 23)
- **Why it's urgent:** We need this data to diagnose the zero conversion problem before we waste more budget

## Questions or Problems?

If you get stuck at any step:
1. Take a screenshot of what you're seeing
2. Note which step number you're on
3. Ask the agent for help with that specific step

Most common issue: GA4 interface differences. Google updates the UI frequently, so button locations might vary slightly. Look for similar icons or menu items if exact names don't match.
