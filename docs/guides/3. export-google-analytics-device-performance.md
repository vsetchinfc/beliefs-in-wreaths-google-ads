# How to Get Device Performance Data from Google Analytics 4

## Purpose
This guide shows you how to compare mobile vs desktop vs tablet performance to identify if your conversion problem is device-specific (e.g., mobile users have terrible experience, desktop users convert fine).

---

## Why This Matters

Many e-commerce sites have **huge mobile vs desktop gaps**:
- Desktop: 60% engagement, 3% conversion rate
- Mobile: 30% engagement, 0.5% conversion rate ‚Üê 6X WORSE

If 80% of your Google Ads traffic is mobile and mobile UX is broken, that's why you have zero conversions.

---

## What You'll Get
- **Sessions by device** (Mobile, Desktop, Tablet)
- **Engagement rate by device**
- **Bounce rate by device**
- **Average engagement time by device**
- **Conversions by device**
- **Revenue by device** (if e-commerce tracking is enabled)

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access Google Analytics 4

1. Go to [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com)
2. Select your **Beliefs in Wreaths** property
3. Verify you're in the correct property (check top-left)

---

### Step 2: Navigate to Tech Report

1. In the left sidebar, click **Reports**
2. Click **Tech** (under "User" section)
3. Click **Tech details** (or "Overview")

**Alternative path:**
- Reports ‚Üí User attributes ‚Üí Tech ‚Üí Overview
- Some GA4 versions show it as "Technology"

---

### Step 3: Set Date Range

1. Top-right corner, click the date picker
2. Select **Custom**
3. Set: **September 1, 2025** to **October 22, 2025**
4. Click **Apply**

---

### Step 4: Select "Device Category" Dimension

By default, the report might show "Browser" or "Operating System."

1. Look for a dropdown that says "Browser" or "Platform" at the top of the data table
2. Click it to open dimension selector
3. Select **Device category**

Now you'll see three rows:
- **mobile**
- **desktop**
- **tablet**

---

### Step 5: Add Filter for Google Ads Traffic ONLY

To see device breakdown specifically from your Google Ads campaign:

1. Click **Add filter** (funnel icon, usually near top)
2. Configure filter:
   - **Dimension:** Session source / medium
   - **Match type:** contains
   - **Value:** `google / cpc`
3. Click **Apply**

**Now you're seeing ONLY Google Ads traffic broken down by device type.**

---

### Step 6: Customize Metrics to Show What We Need

1. Click the **pencil icon** (‚úèÔ∏è) or **Customize report** button
2. In the **Metrics** section, ensure these are checked:

**Critical metrics to include:**
- ‚úÖ **Users** (total unique visitors)
- ‚úÖ **Sessions** (total visits)
- ‚úÖ **Engagement rate** (% of engaged sessions)
- ‚úÖ **Average engagement time** (how long people stay)
- ‚úÖ **Bounce rate** (or "Not engaged sessions %")
- ‚úÖ **Conversions** (total purchases)
- ‚úÖ **Event count** (total interactions)
- ‚úÖ **Events per session** (interaction frequency)

3. Click **Apply** when done

---

### Step 7: Analyze the Data

You'll see a table like this:

| Device Category | Sessions | Engagement Rate | Avg Engagement Time | Bounce Rate | Conversions |
|----------------|----------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| mobile | 650 | 28% | 25 sec | 72% | 0 |
| desktop | 200 | 65% | 1m 45s | 35% | 0 |
| tablet | 26 | 45% | 55 sec | 55% | 0 |

---

### Step 8: Interpret the Results

#### Scenario A: Mobile is MUCH worse than desktop

**Example data:**
- Mobile: 28% engagement, 25 sec time, 72% bounce
- Desktop: 65% engagement, 1m 45s time, 35% bounce

**Diagnosis:** Mobile UX is the problem
- Slow mobile load time
- Images not optimized for mobile
- Checkout process broken on mobile
- Buttons/forms don't work well on small screens

**Action:** Focus ALL fixes on mobile experience first (where 74% of traffic comes from)

---

#### Scenario B: Both desktop AND mobile have terrible engagement

**Example data:**
- Mobile: 30% engagement, 30 sec time, 70% bounce
- Desktop: 35% engagement, 40 sec time, 65% bounce

**Diagnosis:** Universal problem, not device-specific
- Price shock (too expensive for market)
- Wrong audience (keywords attracting people looking for cheap items)
- Product doesn't match expectations from ad
- Trust issues (new site, no reviews, no guarantees)

**Action:** Fix product pages, pricing presentation, trust signals across all devices

---

#### Scenario C: Good engagement, zero conversions on ALL devices

**Example data:**
- Mobile: 60% engagement, 2m 15s time, 40% bounce, 0 conversions
- Desktop: 65% engagement, 2m 45s time, 35% bounce, 0 conversions

**Diagnosis:** Cart/checkout is the problem
- People are interested (good engagement)
- They explore the site (good time on page)
- But something blocks purchase at final step

**Action:** Fix cart page, add payment options (Afterpay/Zip), reduce shipping costs, add guarantees

---

### Step 9: Export the Data

1. Click **Export** button (üì• icon, usually top-right)
2. Select format:
   - **CSV** (recommended - detailed data)
   - **PDF** (quick visual reference)
   - **Google Sheets** (for spreadsheet analysis)

3. Download and save as: `ga4-device-performance-sept1-oct22.csv`

---

### Step 10: Take a Screenshot (Alternative)

If export isn't working:

1. Make sure all three device categories are visible (mobile, desktop, tablet)
2. Make sure key metrics are showing (engagement rate, avg time, bounce rate, conversions)
3. Press **Windows Key + Shift + S**
4. Select the entire table
5. Save as: `ga4-device-breakdown.png`

---

## Additional Analysis: Landing Page by Device

To see which landing pages perform worst on mobile:

### Step 1: Go to Landing Page Report

1. Reports ‚Üí Engagement ‚Üí **Landing page**
2. Set date range: **Sept 1 - Oct 22, 2025**
3. Add filter: **Session source / medium** = `google / cpc`

### Step 2: Add Secondary Dimension

1. Look for **+** button or **Add dimension** (usually near the "Landing page" dimension name)
2. Click it
3. Select **Device category**

Now you'll see:

| Landing Page | Device | Sessions | Engagement Rate | Conversions |
|-------------|--------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| /collections/christmas-wreaths | mobile | 480 | 25% | 0 |
| /collections/christmas-wreaths | desktop | 150 | 68% | 0 |
| /christmas-collection | mobile | 95 | 30% | 0 |
| /christmas-collection | desktop | 45 | 62% | 0 |

**This shows you EXACTLY which landing page + device combo is the problem.**

### Step 3: Export This Report Too

1. Export as CSV: `ga4-landing-page-by-device-sept1-oct22.csv`
2. Or screenshot: `ga4-landing-page-device-breakdown.png`

### Step 3: Add Segment

1. Under **Segments**, click **+**
2. Create custom segment: "Google Ads Traffic"
3. Condition: **Session source / medium** contains `google / cpc`
4. Save and apply

### Step 4: Build Table

1. Drag **Device category** to **Rows**

## What This Reveals

### Critical Question 1: Is mobile the problem?

**If mobile has:**
- 70%+ bounce rate AND
- <40% engagement rate AND
- <30 seconds avg time

**Then mobile UX is terrible** ‚Üí Priority #1 fix is mobile optimization

---

### Critical Question 2: What % of traffic is mobile?

**If mobile = 600 sessions, desktop = 200 sessions:**
- 75% of traffic is mobile
- If mobile UX is broken, 75% of your budget is wasted
- **Fix mobile FIRST** even if desktop converts better

---

### Critical Question 3: Do ANY devices show conversions?

**If desktop has 1-2 conversions but mobile has 0:**
- Problem is device-specific (mobile UX/speed)
- Desktop proves your offer/product works
- Just need to replicate desktop experience on mobile

**If ALL devices have 0 conversions:**
- Problem is universal (product, price, trust, audience)
- Device optimization won't help
- Need to fix core offer/landing page

---

## Mobile-Specific Tests to Run

Once you have the data, if mobile looks like the problem:

### Test 1: Load Your Site on Mobile Right Now

1. Open your phone
2. Go to: `https://beliefsinwreaths.com.au/collections/christmas-wreaths`
3. Time how long until images fully load: **_____ seconds**
4. Try to add a product to cart
5. Does it work smoothly? Any errors?

**What to check:**
- Load time >3 seconds = too slow
- Images huge/slow to load = not optimized
- Buttons too small/hard to tap = UX issue
- Checkout requires typing a lot = friction

---

### Test 2: Check Mobile Page Speed

1. Go to [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev)
2. Enter: `https://beliefsinwreaths.com.au/collections/christmas-wreaths`
3. Wait for test to complete
4. Check **Mobile** score (not desktop)

**Scoring:**
- 90-100 (Green) = Fast ‚úÖ
- 50-89 (Orange) = Average ‚ö†Ô∏è
- 0-49 (Red) = Slow ‚ùå **MAJOR PROBLEM**

5. Screenshot the results
6. Save as: `pagespeed-mobile-results.png`

---

### Test 3: Complete Test Purchase on Mobile

1. On your phone, go to your site
2. Add a wreath to cart
3. Go to checkout
4. Start entering shipping info
5. **STOP before completing** (don't create fake order)

**What to note:**
- How many steps to checkout?
- How much typing required?
- Are payment options visible? (Afterpay, Zip, credit card)
- Any errors or confusing parts?

---

## Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem: "Tech report doesn't show Device category"

**Solution:**
- Look for dimension selector/dropdown at top of table
- Click it and choose "Device category" from list
- If not available, use the Exploration method (Method 2 above)

### Problem: "Only seeing 'desktop' or 'mobile', not both"

**Solution:**
- Remove any filters except Google Ads traffic filter
- Check date range is long enough (Sept 1 - Oct 22)
- You might genuinely have 95%+ mobile traffic (common for Google Ads)

### Problem: "Numbers seem wrong or very low"

**Solution:**
- Verify filter is `google / cpc` not something else
- Check you're in the right property (beliefsinwreaths.com.au)
- Compare total sessions to your Google Ads clicks (should be similar)

### Problem: "Can't export report"

**Solution:**
- Take screenshot instead (Windows Key + Shift + S)
- Or manually type the data into the summary format above
- Or ask property owner to grant you export permissions

---

## Expected Timeline

- **Standard device report:** 5-10 minutes
- **Landing page by device:** +5 minutes
- **Mobile speed test:** 5 minutes
- **Mobile UX test (on phone):** 10 minutes
- **Total time:** 25-30 minutes

---

## Why This Is Critical for Your Campaign

**Current situation:**
- $624 spent, 876 clicks, 0 conversions
- You mentioned: "People browsing through categories and leaving, max 43 seconds on page"

**Likely scenario (common pattern):**
- 70-80% of traffic is mobile (Google Ads defaults to mobile)
- Mobile site loads slowly or has UX issues
- Mobile users bounce quickly (28% engagement, 25 sec time)
- Desktop users engage well but aren't enough volume to generate conversions

**If this is true:**
- Fixing mobile UX could 3-5X your conversion rate
- You'd start seeing sales from the same keywords/ads
- No budget increase needed - just better mobile experience

---

## What Happens After You Provide This Data

Once you send device performance data, we'll:

1. **Confirm if mobile is the bottleneck** (or if it's universal)
2. **Calculate mobile vs desktop engagement gap** (how much worse mobile is)
3. **Prioritize fixes by device + page** (which combo needs work first)
4. **Create mobile optimization checklist** (if mobile is the issue)
5. **Recommend Shopify mobile fixes** (theme adjustments, speed improvements)

**Goal:** Get mobile engagement rate from ~30% to 55%+ (matching desktop)

This could unlock 20-40 conversions from your existing budget over the next 54 days.

## Questions or Problems?

If you get stuck:
1. Screenshot what you're seeing
2. Note which step you're on
3. Ask agent for clarification on that specific step

The device breakdown is one of the most revealing reports - it often shows that 80% of traffic comes from one device with 90% bounce rate, explaining the entire conversion problem.

Let's get this data and find your specific bottleneck!
