# How to Get User Flow & Behavior Data from Google Analytics 4

## Purpose
This guide shows you how to see WHERE visitors go on your site, WHAT they click, and WHERE they drop off - critical for understanding why people browse but don't buy.

---

## What You'll Get
- **User journey paths** - Which pages visitors view in sequence
- **Drop-off points** - Where people leave your site
- **Popular navigation paths** - Most common page sequences
- **Exit pages** - Which pages people leave from
- **Click behavior** - What elements visitors interact with

---

## Method 1: Path Exploration (Best for Seeing Journey)

### Step 1: Access Path Exploration

1. Go to [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com)

---

### Step 2: Configure the Exploration

You'll see a builder interface with tabs and panels.

3. Under **Settings**, adjust:
   - **Steps:** Change from 3 to **5** (to see longer journeys)
   - **Display:** Select "Tree" or "Sankey" (both show flow, pick what looks clearer)

---

### Step 3: Analyze the Flow

The visualization will show:

```
Landing Page ‚Üí Page 2 ‚Üí Page 3 ‚Üí Page 4 ‚Üí Page 5 ‚Üí Exit
```

**What to look for:**

#### Red Flag 1: Immediate Drop-Off
```
/collections/christmas-wreaths (876 visitors)
  ‚Üì
  [EXIT] (700 visitors leave immediately)
  ‚Üì
  /products/luxury-wreath (176 continue)
```
**Diagnosis:** High bounce rate, people aren't even exploring

#### Red Flag 2: Cart Abandonment
```
/products/luxury-wreath (300 visitors)
  ‚Üì
  /cart (120 add to cart)
  ‚Üì
  [EXIT] (115 leave from cart page)

  ‚Üì
  /collections/christmas-wreaths?page=2 (browsing)
  ‚Üì
  /collections/candle-holders (exploring catalog)
  ‚Üì
  /collections/christmas-wreaths (back to wreaths)
  ‚Üì
  [EXIT] (never clicked a product)
```
**Diagnosis:** Collection page doesn't entice clicks to product pages

---

### Step 4: Export Path Data

1. Click the **Export** button (üì• icon, usually top-right)
2. Select format:
   - **PDF** for visual reference
   - **CSV** for detailed data
3. Save as: `ga4-user-path-sept1-oct22.pdf` (or .csv)

**OR take a screenshot:**
- Press **Windows Key + Shift + S**
- Capture the entire flow visualization
- Save as `ga4-user-flow-visualization.png`

---

## Method 2: Pages and Screens Report (Best for Exit Pages)

### Step 1: Navigate to Pages Report

1. In left sidebar, click **Reports**
2. Click **Engagement**
3. Click **Pages and screens**

---

### Step 2: Set Date Range

1. Top-right date picker
2. **September 1 - October 22, 2025**
3. Apply

---

### Step 3: Add Filter for Google Ads Traffic

1. Click **Add filter** (funnel icon)
2. Set:
   - **Session source / medium** ‚Üí **contains** ‚Üí `google / cpc`
3. Apply

---

### Step 4: Add "Exits" Metric

1. Click the **pencil icon** (‚úèÔ∏è) or **Customize report**
2. In **Metrics** section, add:
   - ‚úÖ **Exits** (total number of times page was the last in session)
   - ‚úÖ **Exit rate** (% of views that were the last page)
   - ‚úÖ **Views** (total page views)
3. Click Apply

---

### Step 5: Sort by Exit Rate

1. Click the **Exit rate** column header to sort
2. Pages at the top = highest exit rate (problem pages)

**What you're looking for:**

| Page Path | Views | Exits | Exit Rate |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| /cart | 150 | 140 | 93% ‚Üê PROBLEM |
| /products/luxury-christmas-wreath | 250 | 230 | 92% ‚Üê PROBLEM |
| /collections/christmas-wreaths | 600 | 400 | 67% |
| /checkout/shipping | 10 | 2 | 20% ‚Üê GOOD (people continuing) |

**Diagnosis examples:**
- **Cart has 93% exit rate** = Payment options, shipping cost, or trust issue
- **Product page has 92% exit rate** = Price shock, poor images, missing info, slow load
- **Checkout has 20% exit rate** = Normal (most who reach checkout complete it)

---

### Step 6: Export the Data

1. Click **Export** (üì• icon)
2. Choose **CSV** format
3. Save as: `ga4-exit-pages-sept1-oct22.csv`

---

## Method 3: Events Report (Best for Click Behavior)

### Step 1: Navigate to Events Report

1. In left sidebar, click **Reports**
2. Click **Engagement**
3. Click **Events**

---

### Step 2: Set Date Range & Filter

1. Date range: **September 1 - October 22, 2025**
2. Add filter: **Session source / medium** ‚Üí **contains** ‚Üí `google / cpc`

---

### Step 3: Look for Key Events

Sort by **Event count** (click column header) to see most frequent events.

**Events to look for:**

| Event Name | What It Means | What to Check |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| `page_view` | Page loads | Total should match Google Ads clicks (~876) |
| `scroll` | User scrolled down page | If low = people don't scroll (mobile issue?) |
| `click` | Any link/button clicked | High count = engagement, low = no interaction |
| `view_item` | Product page viewed | Should see this from collection pages |
| `add_to_cart` | Added product to cart | **CRITICAL - is this firing?** |
| `begin_checkout` | Started checkout process | How many reach here? |
| `purchase` | Completed purchase | Should match conversions (currently 0) |

---

### Step 4: Check if "Add to Cart" is Firing

1. Find the **`add_to_cart`** event in the list
2. Check the **Event count**

**Possible outcomes:**

#### Outcome A: `add_to_cart` event count = 0
**Diagnosis:** People aren't even trying to buy. Problem is BEFORE the cart.
- Focus on: Product page UX, images, descriptions, trust, price presentation

#### Outcome B: `add_to_cart` event count = 50-100+
**Diagnosis:** People ARE adding to cart but not completing purchase. Problem is AFTER cart.
- Focus on: Cart page, shipping costs, payment options, checkout UX

#### Outcome C: `add_to_cart` event doesn't exist
**Diagnosis:** Shopify event tracking isn't set up correctly
- Need to verify Shopify ‚Üí GA4 integration

---

### Step 5: Export Events Data

1. Click **Export** (üì•)
2. Save as CSV: `ga4-events-sept1-oct22.csv`

---

## Method 4: Realtime Report (Test Right Now)

This lets you see what happens when YOU visit your site, to verify tracking works.

### Step 1: Open Realtime Report

1. In left sidebar, click **Reports**
2. Click **Realtime** (at the top of the reports list)

---

### Step 2: Open Your Website in Another Tab

1. Open a new browser tab (use Incognito/Private mode to be safe)
2. Go to your site: `https://beliefsinwreaths.com.au/collections/christmas-wreaths`

---

### Step 3: Navigate Like a Customer

1. Click on a product (e.g., luxury wreath)
2. Scroll down the product page
3. Click "Add to Cart"
4. Go to cart
5. Start checkout (but don't complete - don't want fake order)

---

### Step 4: Watch the Realtime Report

Go back to the GA4 Realtime report tab and watch:

**What you should see:**
- **1 active user** (you)
- **Events:** `page_view`, `scroll`, `click`, `view_item`, `add_to_cart`, `begin_checkout`
- **Page paths:** Shows your journey through the pages

**If events DON'T appear:**
- There's a tracking problem
- GA4 isn't receiving data from Shopify correctly
- Need to fix integration before diagnosis

---

### Step 5: Screenshot the Realtime Data

1. While you're still the active user, take a screenshot of:
   - The event list (showing all events fired)
   - The user path visualization
2. Save as: `ga4-realtime-test.png`

**This proves tracking is working (or reveals if it's broken).**

---

## What to Send to Agent

After completing these methods, provide:

### Essential Data Package:

1. **Path Exploration visual** (screenshot or PDF)
   - Shows the flow from landing page ‚Üí exit
   
2. **Exit pages report** (CSV or screenshot)
   - Shows which pages have highest exit rate
   
3. **Events report** (CSV or screenshot)
   - Especially the count for `add_to_cart` and `begin_checkout`
   
4. **Realtime test** (screenshot)
   - Proves tracking works when you personally test

### Quick Summary Format:

If you can't export, just type this summary:

```
PATH FLOW (most common journey):
1. Landing: /collections/christmas-wreaths (876 visitors)
2. Next: [where do most go?] (X visitors)
3. Next: [third page] (X visitors)
4. Exit point: [page where most leave]

EXIT PAGES (highest exit rate):
1. [page path] - X% exit rate
2. [page path] - X% exit rate
3. [page path] - X% exit rate

KEY EVENTS:
- add_to_cart: [count] events
- begin_checkout: [count] events
- purchase: [count] events (should be 0)

REALTIME TEST:
- Events fired when I tested: [yes/no]
- Add to cart tracked: [yes/no]
```

## What This Reveals

### Scenario 1: High Exit from Product Pages
**Symptom:** 90% exit rate from `/products/luxury-christmas-wreath`
**Diagnosis:** Price shock, poor mobile UX, slow load, missing trust signals
**Fix:** Optimize product page (payment options, better images, reviews, urgency)

### Scenario 2: High Exit from Cart
**Symptom:** 95% exit rate from `/cart` page
**Diagnosis:** Shipping cost surprise, lack of payment options, trust issues
**Fix:** Show shipping cost earlier, add Afterpay/Zip, add guarantees

### Scenario 3: No Add to Cart Events
**Symptom:** `add_to_cart` event count = 0 despite 876 clicks
**Diagnosis:** People aren't even attempting to purchase
**Fix:** Fundamental product/pricing/trust problem on product pages

### Scenario 4: Add to Cart But No Checkout
**Symptom:** 100 `add_to_cart` events, 5 `begin_checkout` events
**Diagnosis:** Cart page is the barrier
**Fix:** Simplify cart, remove friction, add trust signals

## Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem: "I don't see the Explore tab"
**Solution:** 
- You might not have edit permissions on GA4 property
- Ask account owner to grant you "Editor" access
- Alternative: Ask them to run this report for you

### Problem: "Path exploration is empty"
**Solution:**
- Check date range is correct
- Remove any filters except Google Ads traffic filter
- Make sure "Starting point" is set to "Landing page" or "Page path"

### Problem: "Events report shows very few events"
**Solution:**
- Shopify ‚Üí GA4 integration might be incomplete
- Run the Realtime test (Method 4) to verify tracking works
- If Realtime shows events but historical doesn't, there's a data collection gap

### Problem: "Numbers don't match Google Ads clicks (876)"
**Solution:**
- GA4 might count sessions differently than Google Ads counts clicks
- Small discrepancy (10-20%) is normal
- Large discrepancy (50%+) means tracking problem or filter issue

---

## Expected Timeline

- **Path Exploration:** 5-10 minutes to set up and export
- **Exit Pages Report:** 5 minutes to configure and export
- **Events Report:** 5 minutes to find and export
- **Realtime Test:** 5 minutes to test and verify
- **Total time:** 20-30 minutes

## Why This Matters for Your Campaign

You mentioned: *"People were visiting site, many browsing through many categories and leaving. Maximum spent time on page is 43 seconds."*

This user flow analysis will show us:

1. **Are people actually browsing categories?** (Path data will show if they visit multiple collection pages)
2. **Where exactly do they leave?** (Exit pages will pinpoint the problem page)
3. **Do they click on products?** (Path will show if collection ‚Üí product happens)
4. **Do they add to cart at all?** (Events will show if add_to_cart fires)

With this data, we can create a targeted fix instead of guessing.

**You have 54 days until Christmas cutoff - every day without conversions is lost revenue during the peak season.**

---

## Next Steps After Analysis

Once you provide this data, we'll:

1. **Identify the exact drop-off point** (product page? cart? checkout?)
2. **Match it with engagement data** (quick bounce? or browsing then leaving?)
3. **Create a prioritized fix list** with specific UX/copy/design changes
4. **Implement quick wins first** (can deploy in 24-48 hours)
5. **Test with a small budget increase** to validate fixes work

Let's get this data and fix your conversion problem before November (peak shopping month) arrives!
