```

**4. Click on the Current Bid**

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting: Can't See Max. CPC Column?

### Problem
You don't see a "Max. CPC" column in your Keywords table.

### How to Fix It

**1. Go to Campaign Settings**
- In the left sidebar, click **"Campaigns"**
- Click on your **campaign name** in the table
- Click **"Settings"** in the left submenu

**2. Find Bidding Section**
- Scroll down to **"Bidding"** section
- You'll see current strategy (e.g., "Maximize clicks") with a pencil/edit icon ✏️

**3. Change to Manual CPC**
- Click the **pencil/edit icon** ✏️ next to the bidding strategy
- Select **"Manual CPC"** or **"Directly select clicks or conversions you want"**
- Then choose **"Manual CPC"**
- Optional: Enable **"Enhanced CPC"** toggle (recommended for better performance)

**4. Save Changes**
- Click **"Save"**
- Return to Keywords section

**5. Now You Can Edit Individual Bids**
- The "Max. CPC" column will now appear
- Follow Method 1 or Method 2 above

## 🎓 Understanding Bid Strategy

### How Google Ads Bidding Works

**Your Max CPC Bid:**
- Maximum you'll pay per click
- Actual cost is often lower
- You pay $0.01 more than competitor below you

**Example:**
```
Your max bid: $1.50
Competitor 1: $1.40
Competitor 2: $1.20
Your actual cost: $1.41 (not $1.50!)
```

### Ad Rank Formula
```
Ad Rank = Max CPC Bid × Quality Score × Expected Impact of Extensions
```

**This means:**
- Higher bid + High quality = Top position
- Lower bid + Low quality = Poor position or no impressions
- Best strategy: Optimize both bid AND quality
