- Click on your **campaign name**
- Click **"Settings"** in the left menu

**2. Find Bidding Section**
- Scroll down to **"Bidding"** section

- Select **"Manual CPC"** from the dropdown
- Check the box: **"Help increase conversions with Enhanced CPC"** (recommended)

**4. Save Changes**
- Click **"Save"**
- Return to Keywords section

**5. Now You Can Edit Individual Bids**

## 🎓 Understanding Bid Strategy

### How Google Ads Bidding Works

**Your Max CPC Bid:**
- Maximum you'll pay per click
- Actual cost is often lower
- You pay $0.01 more than competitor below you

**Example:**
```
Your max bid: $1.50
Competitor 1: $1.40
Competitor 2: $1.20
Your actual cost: $1.41 (not $1.50!)
```

### Ad Rank Formula
```
Ad Rank = Max CPC Bid × Quality Score × Expected Impact of Extensions
```

**This means:**
- Higher bid + High quality = Top position
- Lower bid + Low quality = Poor position or no impressions
- Best strategy: Optimize both bid AND quality
