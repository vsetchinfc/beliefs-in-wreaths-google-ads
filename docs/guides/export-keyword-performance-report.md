```

---

### Issue 2: All Keywords Show "Low search volume"

**Why this happens:**
- Keyword is too specific

- Google won't show ads for it

**Solution:**
1. **Remove** these keywords (they won't run anyway)
2. **Use broader match types:**
   - Instead of: [luxury christmas wreath sydney northern beaches]
   - Use: "luxury christmas wreath sydney"
3. **Focus on** keywords with actual volume

---

### Issue 3: Quality Score Shows "--"

**Why:**
- Keyword is too new (less than 1 week active)
- Keyword has very few impressions
- Need more data

**Solution:**
- Wait 1-2 weeks
- Check if keyword is actually showing (check impressions)
- If still "--" after 2 weeks, consider pausing

---

### Issue 4: High Clicks, Zero Conversions

**Possible causes:**
1. **Wrong keyword** (not purchase intent)
2. **Landing page issues** (slow, broken, irrelevant)
3. **Price too high** (people click but don't buy)
4. **Conversion tracking broken** (sales happening but not tracked)

**Solution:**
1. Check search terms report (what queries triggered clicks?)
2. Test your landing page (does it load fast? Clear CTA?)
3. Verify conversion tracking is working
4. If all looks good ‚Üí Keyword is just not converting ‚Üí PAUSE
