## üìä Current vs Premium Comparison

### CURRENT (Ad #2 - Generic):

**Headlines attracting bargain hunters:**
- ‚ùå "Browse Our Wreath Collection" - Generic
- ‚ùå "Free Delivery Over $150" - Focuses on savings
- ‚ùå "Browse Our Range Online" - No differentiation
- ‚ùå "Personalise Your Wreath" - Commodity positioning

**Descriptions:**
- ‚ùå "Shop Our Collection of Stylish Wreaths..." - Generic retail language
- ‚ùå No price anchoring - allows bargain hunters to click
- ‚ùå No premium positioning

**Result:** 
- Getting clicks from wrong audience
- Attracting $90 sale hunters
- Not emphasizing $150+ premium positioning

---

### PREMIUM (New Copy):

**Headlines attracting luxury buyers:**
- ‚úÖ "Luxury Christmas Wreaths $150+" - Price anchoring
- ‚úÖ "Limited Edition - Only 1-2 Left" - Scarcity
- ‚úÖ "Investment Pieces That Last" - Quality signal
- ‚úÖ "Museum-Quality Floral Design" - Premium positioning
- ‚úÖ "Handcrafted in Australia" - Artisan credibility

**Descriptions:**
- ‚úÖ "$150-$300" - Sets expectations upfront
- ‚úÖ "Investment pieces" - Premium language
- ‚úÖ "Museum-quality" - High-end positioning
- ‚úÖ "Only 1-2 pieces" - Exclusivity

**Expected Result:**
- CTR may drop 10-20% (GOOD - filtering out bargain hunters)
- Conversion rate on $150+ items increases
- Attracts right audience who expects premium pricing
