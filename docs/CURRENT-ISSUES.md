## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 4. 87% of Budget on One Broad Keyword

**Status**: HIGH - Inefficient spend

**The Problem**:
- "christmas decorations" keyword: $21.38 spent (87% of total $24.51)
- This keyword is very broad - could match:
  - Christmas lights, trees, ornaments, stockings, baubles, tinsel
  - Not all relevant to wreaths

**Current Performance**:
- 33 clicks
- 303 impressions
- 10.89% CTR (good)
- But Quality Score only 4/10 (poor)

**Risk**:
- Wasting budget on irrelevant clicks
- People searching "christmas decorations" might want lights, not wreaths

**Solution Required**:
1. Check Search Terms Report immediately
2. Add negative keywords for non-wreath decorations
3. Consider changing to phrase match: "christmas decorations"
4. Or reduce bid to reallocate budget to more specific keywords

### 5. Irrelevant Keywords in Campaign

**Status**: HIGH - Wasting ad group quality

**The Problem**:
Several keywords are too broad or off-topic:

| Keyword | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| unique gift | Too broad, not wreath-specific |
| wreath | Too generic, could trigger funeral searches |
| front door | Way too broad (doors, locks, mats, decorations) |
| artificial wreaths | Check if relevant to product offerings |
| floral wreath | Could trigger funeral/sympathy searches |
| christmas gifts | $0 spent, 0 clicks, 0% CTR - completely inactive |

**Impact**:
- Diluting ad group relevance
- Risk of triggering irrelevant searches
- Lowering overall Quality Score

**Solution Required**:
Pause or remove these keywords immediately.

---

### 6. No Comprehensive Negative Keywords

**Status**: HIGH - Wasting budget

**The Problem**:
Only 5 negative keywords added: free, DIY, tutorial, how to make, cheap

**Missing Critical Negatives**:
- Funeral/sympathy related: funeral, sympathy, memorial, condolence
- DIY/craft: pattern, instructions, template, craft
- Other decorations: ornaments, lights, tree, tinsel, stockings, baubles
- Wrong intent: wholesale, bulk, commercial, rental

**Impact**:
Broad match keywords (especially "christmas decorations") will trigger irrelevant searches, wasting clicks.

**Solution Required**:
Add comprehensive negative keyword list (see ACTION-CHECKLIST.md).
