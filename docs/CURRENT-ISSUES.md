## ÔøΩ CRITICAL ISSUES (IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED)

### 1. All Year Products Ad Group is PAUSED ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**Status**: CRITICAL - 27 core keywords completely inactive

**The Problem**:
- **ALL 27 keywords in "All Year Products" ad group are not serving**
- These are your best wreath-specific keywords:
  - "front door wreaths australia"
  - "door wreath"
  - "artificial wreaths"
  - "elegant front door wreaths"
  - "all season door wreath"
  - + 22 more
- Ad group status: PAUSED
- Result: 0 impressions, 0 clicks, 0 opportunity for sales

**Impact**:
- Losing ALL potential traffic for year-round wreath sales
- Only relying on Christmas Products (seasonal limitation)
- Missing out on high-intent "buy" and "australia" searches
- Competitors capturing this traffic instead

**IMMEDIATE ACTION**:
1. Log into Google Ads TODAY
2. Navigate to "All Year Products" ad group
3. Check why it's paused (budget exhausted? manual pause?)
4. Allocate $10-15/day budget to this ad group
5. UNPAUSE the ad group immediately
6. Monitor for 24 hours

### 2. Extremely Low Impression Volume ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**Status**: CRITICAL - Campaign barely visible

**The Problem**:
- **Only 36 total impressions in 2 weeks** (Sep 19 - Oct 2)
- That's ~2.5 impressions per day across entire campaign
- Top performing keyword: "luxury christmas wreath australia" = only 5 impressions
- 83 out of 86 keywords: 0 impressions

**Why This Is Happening**:
- Budget too low (likely $5-10/day)
- Bids too low (keywords not competitive)
- All Year Products paused (see Issue #1)

**Impact**:
- Essentially invisible to potential customers
- Cannot generate meaningful sales at this volume
- Cannot gather data for optimization
- Wasting opportunity during lead-up to Christmas

**IMMEDIATE ACTION**:
1. Increase daily budget to **$20-30 minimum**
2. Increase bids on top keywords:
   - "luxury christmas wreath australia" ‚Üí $1.50
   - "christmas wreath" ‚Üí $1.20
   - "xmas wreaths for front door" ‚Üí $1.00
3. Expected result: 500-1000+ impressions per week

### 3. Zero Conversion Tracking ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**Status**: CRITICAL - Cannot measure ROI

**The Problem**:
- 5 clicks received (from active keywords)
- $3.13 spent
- **0 conversions tracked**
- Cannot measure which keywords drive sales
- Cannot calculate return on ad spend

**Impact**:
- Flying blind - don't know what's working
- Cannot optimize for profitability
- Cannot prove campaign value
- Google's automated bidding cannot work properly

**Solution Required**:
Set up Google Ads conversion tracking for:
1. Purchase/Sale events (primary) ‚Üê MUST HAVE

**Implementation Guide**: See `docs/guides/setup-conversion-tracking.md`

### 4. 15+ Irrelevant Keywords Wasting Budget ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

**Status**: HIGH PRIORITY - Immediate cleanup needed

**The Problem**:
Currently targeting keywords that have NOTHING to do with wreaths:

**Generic Gift Keywords** (NOT wreath-specific):
- "gift for"
- "best present"
- "best gift"
- "cool gifts"
- "fun gift idea"
- "good gift idea"

**Birthday Keywords** (NOT relevant):
- "birthday ideas for women"
- "birthday ideas for her"
- "best birthday gift ideas"
- "best birthday presents"
- "good birthday gift ideas"
- "great birthday gift ideas"

**Other Issues**:
- "Black Friday Sale" (event, not search term)
- "EOFY Sale" (not relevant in September/October)
- "christmas tree store" (not selling trees)

**Impact**:
- These keywords dilute your targeting
- Waste budget on irrelevant clicks
- Lower overall campaign relevance
- Confuse Google's algorithm about what you sell

**IMMEDIATE ACTION**:
DELETE or PAUSE these 15-20 keywords this week

### 5. Low Quality Score Keywords ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Status**: MEDIUM - Affecting ad performance

**The Problem**:
- "front door design" - Low quality, too generic
- "floral wreath" - Low quality, funeral association

**Current Impact**:
- Lower ad rank = fewer impressions
- Higher cost per click
- Ads showing in worse positions

**Solution**:
- Pause "front door design" (not wreath-specific)
- Replace "floral wreath" with "fresh floral door wreath"
- Improve landing page relevance
- Update ad copy to match keywords better

**Quality Score Breakdown**:
- Expected CTR: Unknown (need to check)
- Ad relevance: Average ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Landing page experience: **Below average** ‚ùå

**Root Causes**:
1. Landing page doesn't match ad intent well enough
2. Page may be slow on mobile (82.7% of traffic is mobile!)
3. Unclear call-to-action on landing page
4. Generic "christmas decorations" keyword too broad for wreath-specific landing page

**Solution Required**:
1. **Immediate**: Change Final URL to specific Christmas wreaths collection page
2. Test landing page speed on mobile (target: 80+ PageSpeed score)
3. Ensure landing page has clear headline matching ad copy
4. Add trust signals (reviews, shipping info, guarantees)
5. Consider changing keyword to phrase match: "christmas decorations"

**Implementation Guide**: See [`docs/guides/fix-landing-page-quality.md`](./guides/fix-landing-page-quality.md)

### 3. Ad Group Has Too Few Ads

**Status**: HIGH - Preventing keywords from running

**The Problem**:
Multiple keywords showing status: **"Not eligible - Ad group has too few ads"**

Affected keywords:
- unique gift
- wreath
- front door
- artificial wreaths
- floral wreath

**Impact**:
- These keywords cannot serve ads
- Reducing campaign reach
- Missing potential traffic

**Solution Required**:
Each ad group needs minimum 2 ads (ideally 3) to be eligible.

**Action**:
1. Create 2 additional ad variations in each ad group
2. Test different headlines and messaging
3. Use responsive search ads with multiple headline/description options

**Implementation Guide**: See [`docs/guides/create-multiple-ads.md`](./guides/create-multiple-ads.md)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 4. 87% of Budget on One Broad Keyword

**Status**: HIGH - Inefficient spend

**The Problem**:
- "christmas decorations" keyword: $21.38 spent (87% of total $24.51)
- This keyword is very broad - could match:
  - Christmas lights, trees, ornaments, stockings, baubles, tinsel
  - Not all relevant to wreaths

**Current Performance**:
- 33 clicks
- 303 impressions
- 10.89% CTR (good)
- But Quality Score only 4/10 (poor)

**Risk**:
- Wasting budget on irrelevant clicks
- People searching "christmas decorations" might want lights, not wreaths

**Solution Required**:
1. Check Search Terms Report immediately
2. Add negative keywords for non-wreath decorations
3. Consider changing to phrase match: "christmas decorations"
4. Or reduce bid to reallocate budget to more specific keywords

### 5. Irrelevant Keywords in Campaign

**Status**: HIGH - Wasting ad group quality

**The Problem**:
Several keywords are too broad or off-topic:

| Keyword | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| ‚úÖ**Removed** - unique gift | Too broad, not wreath-specific |
| wreath | Too generic, could trigger funeral searches |
| front door | Way too broad (doors, locks, mats, decorations) |
| artificial wreaths | Check if relevant to product offerings |
| floral wreath | Could trigger funeral/sympathy searches |
| christmas gifts | $0 spent, 0 clicks, 0% CTR - completely inactive |

**Impact**:
- Diluting ad group relevance
- Risk of triggering irrelevant searches
- Lowering overall Quality Score

**Solution Required**:
Pause or remove these keywords immediately.

---

### 6. No Comprehensive Negative Keywords

**Status**: HIGH - Wasting budget

**The Problem**:
Only 5 negative keywords added: free, DIY, tutorial, how to make, cheap

**Missing Critical Negatives**:
- Funeral/sympathy related: funeral, sympathy, memorial, condolence
- DIY/craft: pattern, instructions, template, craft
- Other decorations: ornaments, lights, tree, tinsel, stockings, baubles
- Wrong intent: wholesale, bulk, commercial, rental

**Impact**:
Broad match keywords (especially "christmas decorations") will trigger irrelevant searches, wasting clicks.

**Solution Required**:
Add comprehensive negative keyword list (see ACTION-CHECKLIST.md).
