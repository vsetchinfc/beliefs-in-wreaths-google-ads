# Fixing "Low Search Volume" Keywords Issue

**Problem:** New keywords showing "Not eligible - Low search volume"  
**Date:** October 4, 2025  

---

## üö® What Happened

When you tried to add these exact match keywords:
```
[buy christmas wreath online australia]
[christmas wreath delivery australia]
[christmas door wreath australia]
```

Google rejected them with: **"Not eligible - Low search volume, Under review"**

---

## üí° Why This Happens

**Australia is a smaller market than US/UK:**
- Population: 26 million (vs US: 330 million)
- Fewer people searching for specific phrases
- Exact match with location modifiers = TOO specific
- Example: [buy christmas wreath online australia] might get only 5-10 searches/month

**Google's threshold:** If a keyword gets fewer than ~10 searches per month, they mark it as "low search volume" and won't show ads for it.

## ‚úÖ The Solution

### Strategy 1: Use Phrase Match Instead

Instead of exact match with "australia" in the keyword, use phrase match:

**DON'T USE (Low volume):**
```
[buy christmas wreath online australia] - Exact Match
[christmas wreath delivery australia] - Exact Match
[luxury christmas wreath australia] - Exact Match
```

**USE INSTEAD (Has volume):**
```
"buy christmas wreath" - Phrase Match - Bid: $1.00
"christmas wreath delivery" - Phrase Match - Bid: $1.00
"luxury christmas wreath" - Phrase Match - Bid: $0.90
```

**Then use location targeting to show only in Australia!**

---

### Strategy 2: Focus on Keywords That ARE Working

Looking at your current data, these keywords already have impressions:
- ‚úÖ **luxury christmas wreath australia** (Broad) - 5 impressions, 2 clicks, 40% CTR!
- ‚úÖ **christmas wreath** (Broad) - 24 impressions, 2 clicks, 8.33% CTR
- ‚úÖ **"xmas wreaths for front door"** (Phrase) - 1 impression, 1 click, 100% CTR!

**Action:** Just increase bids on these proven performers:
```
luxury christmas wreath australia ‚Üí $1.20 (from $0.61)
christmas wreath ‚Üí $1.00 (from $0.69)
"xmas wreaths for front door" ‚Üí $0.90 (from $0.55)
```

---

### Strategy 3: Add Broader Keywords with Good Volume

**These should have sufficient search volume:**
```

```

**Use negative keywords to control broad match:**

```
