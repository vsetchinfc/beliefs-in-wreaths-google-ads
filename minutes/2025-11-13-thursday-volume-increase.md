- "laura ashley christmas" - Mid-market brand ❌

**Wrong Products:**
- "luxury christmas tablecloth" - Not a wreath ❌
- "fancy christmas decor" - Too vague ❌
- "exclusive christmas decorations" - Generic decor not wreaths ⚠️

**Wrong Style/Size:**
- "kitsch christmas wreath" - Opposite of luxury ❌
- "big christmas wreath" - Size-focused not quality ❌
- "very large christmas wreath" - Size-focused ❌

**Geographic Waste:**

**Generic/Functional (Low Intent):**
- "christmas wreaths for front door" - Too generic, functional not luxury ⚠️
- "christmas wreaths decorations" - Vague search intent ⚠️
- "best christmas wreaths australia" - Comparison shopping ⚠️

### ❌ "Luxury Christmas Decor" Still Not Serving (Day 3)
- **Status:** $6.00 bid, 0 impressions for 3rd consecutive day
- **Issue:** Bid too low OR Quality Score problem
- **Impact:** Missing $285 converter from Nov 11
- **Lost opportunity:** ~40-50% of potential impressions
- Single keyword strategy forced, not chosen

- 5 key events

**Nov 13 Paid Search:**
- 2 sessions, 0% engagement rate
- 0 seconds avg time

## Device Performance Breakdown

| Device | Impressions | Clicks | CTR | Cost | % of Spend |
|--------|-------------|--------|-----|------|------------|
| Mobile | 37 | 6 | 16.22% | $30.86 | 100% |
| Desktop | 6 | 0 | 0% | $0 | 0% |
| Tablet | 1 | 0 | 0% | $0 | 0% |

**Analysis:** +20% mobile bid adjustment and -70% desktop/tablet adjustments working perfectly. All conversions historically from mobile, so 100% spend allocation is correct.

## Landing Page Distribution

| Landing Page | Impressions | Clicks | CTR |
|--------------|-------------|--------|-----|
| /christmas-wreaths | 57 | 6 | 10.53% |
| /christmas-candle-holders-centrepieces | 38 | 0 | 0% |
| /clearance | 36 | 0 | 0% |
| Other collections | 83 | 0 | 0% |

**Note:** Non-wreath collections getting many impressions but 0 clicks. These are likely from Dynamic Search Ads or broad match keywords showing for wrong searches. All actual clicks going to correct wreath collection page.

## Three-Day Comparison ($30/day Budget Era)

| Date | Spend | Impressions | Clicks | CTR | Avg CPC | Waste % | Keywords Serving |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|-----|---------|---------|-----------------|

| **Nov 14 Target** | **$30** | **40-50** | **6-8** | **12-15%** | **$4.50-5.50** | **<10%** | **2** |

## Strategic Assessment

### What's Working:
1. ✅ Budget management improved (103% vs 114% yesterday)
2. ✅ Volume tripling shows auction competitiveness
3. ✅ Cost efficiency improving ($5.14 CPC down from $6.84)
4. ✅ Device targeting optimal (100% mobile spend)
5. ✅ Some excellent quality searches (designer, split wreath, provincial)
6. ✅ Direct traffic showing strong conversion signals (16 key events)

### What's Broken:
1. ❌ "Luxury christmas decor" 3 days with 0 impressions unacceptable
2. ❌ 45% waste rate returned after 0% yesterday
3. ❌ GA4 paid search engagement dropped to 0%
4. ❌ Brand competitor searches eating impressions
5. ❌ Wrong product searches (tablecloth, generic decor)
6. ❌ Single keyword dependency creating volume limitations

### Root Cause Analysis:

**Why did waste return?**
- Phrase match "stylish christmas wreaths" casting wider net as it gains Quality Score
- More impressions = more close variants triggering
- Google testing broader match variations
- Insufficient negative keywords to block waste categories

**Why isn't "luxury christmas decor" serving?**
- $6.00 bid too low for competitive auction
- Possible Quality Score issue (ad relevance, landing page, expected CTR)
- May need $7.50-8.00 to compete with "stylish" getting all the budget

## Next Actions - Completed Nov 13 Evening

### ✅ Priority 1: Add Negative Keywords
**Status:** COMPLETED
- Added 11 negatives blocking brands, wrong products, wrong styles

## Tomorrow's Expectations (Nov 14 Friday)

### Expected Results from Actions:

**From Negative Keywords:**
- Waste drops to <10% (from 45%)
- No more: tk maxx, zara, laura ashley, tablecloth, kitsch, perth, big, large searches
- Cleaner search terms report

- Budget split: ~50% stylish, ~50% luxury decor

**Overall Nov 14 Forecast:**

### Critical Morning Check (Nov 14 9-10 AM):

   - If YES: Success! Dual-keyword strategy working
   - If NO: Quality Score issue, may need landing page review

   - Search terms report should be much cleaner

3. **GA4 engagement recovering?**
   - Paid Search sessions should show engagement again
   - Key events should return (target: 2-5 per day)

## Conversion Expectation Window

**Based on 2-3 day consideration cycle:**
- Mon Nov 10: Sale #1 ($185)
- Tue Nov 11: Sale #2 ($285)
- Wed Nov 12: Accumulation day (high engagement in GA4)
- Thu Nov 13: Accumulation day (16 key events in Direct traffic)
- **Fri Nov 14 - Sat Nov 15: LIKELY CONVERSION WINDOW** 🎯

**Supporting Evidence:**
- 16 key events in Direct traffic today (returning visitors)
- 3 key events in Unassigned (possible attribution lag)
- Historical pattern: Multiple clicks → 2-day wait → Purchase
- Strong engagement Nov 12, now people returning to buy

## Key Learnings

### 1. Phrase Match Expands Over Time
- "Stylish christmas wreaths" started tight, now casting wider net
- More impressions = more close variants = more waste potential
- Negative keywords must be added continuously, not just at setup
- Monitor search terms daily when running phrase match

### 2. $6.00 Bid Insufficient for Secondary Keyword
- "Luxury christmas decor" invisible at $6.00 for 3 straight days
- In competitive luxury auction, need $7+ bids to participate
- Quality Score alone can't overcome insufficient bid
- Secondary keywords need equal or higher bids to compete with primary

### 3. Volume Growth = Waste Growth Without Negatives
- 16 → 44 impressions = 175% growth
- But waste went 0% → 45% simultaneously
- More volume exposes gaps in negative keyword coverage
- Must scale negative keywords as campaign volume scales

### 4. GA4 Engagement Correlates with Traffic Quality
- Nov 12: 0% waste, 100% engagement, 5 key events
- Nov 13: 45% waste, 0% engagement, 0 key events
- Waste clicks bounce, quality clicks engage
- Engagement rate is early warning signal for waste

### 5. Direct Traffic Key Events = Conversion Lag Indicator
- 16 key events in Direct traffic today
- These are likely returning visitors from ads days ago
- Multi-session journey: Ad click → Research → Direct return → Purchase
- Watch Direct traffic key events for early conversion signals
