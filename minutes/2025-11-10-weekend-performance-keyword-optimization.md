## 🚨 Outstanding Issues

### 1. Conversion Tracking Discrepancy
- **Google Ads:** 0 conversions
- **GA4:** 15 conversions from Paid Search
- **Action needed:** Check Google Ads conversion import from GA4

### 2. Ad Schedule
- Need to verify if ads run 24/7 or limited hours
- Underspending suggests possible scheduling restrictions

### 3. Delivery Method
- Confirm using "Standard" vs "Accelerated" delivery
- Standard may be throttling spend too conservatively
