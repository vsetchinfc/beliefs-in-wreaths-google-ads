# 📅 NOV 15, 2025 (FRIDAY) - KEYWORD SWAP RESULTS & AUTO-APPLY CRISIS

## 🎯 CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Auto-Apply Settings Re-Enabled by Google

**Grade: C-** (Slight improvement in metrics, but keyword swap failed + Google tried to hijack bidding)

### Campaign Performance Summary

| Metric | Today | Yesterday (Nov 14) | Change |
|--------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| **Spend** | $19.96 | $25.61 | -22% |
| **Impressions** | 18 | 13 | +38% 📈 |
| **Clicks** | 3 | 3 | 0% |
| **CTR** | 16.67% | 23.08% | -28% |
| **Avg CPC** | $6.65 | $8.54 | -22% ✅ |
| **Conversions** | 0 | 0 | - |
| **Search Impression Share** | <10% | <10% | - 🔴 |
| **Lost IS (budget)** | >90% | >90% | - |

### 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE #1: Google Auto-Apply Settings Re-Enabled

**Discovery:** During today's review, found that Google had RE-ENABLED 10+ auto-apply recommendation settings without notification, including:

**Dangerous settings that were ON:**
- ✅ Bid more efficiently with Target impression share
- ✅ Bid more efficiently with Maximise clicks
- ✅ Bid more efficiently with Maximise conversions ← Would have auto-switched from Manual CPC!
- ✅ Bid more efficiently with Maximise conversion value
- ✅ Bid more efficiently with Maximise conversions using target CPA
- ✅ Bid more efficiently with Maximise conversion value using target ROAS
- ✅ Set a target CPA
- ✅ Set a target ROAS
- ✅ Adjust your CPA targets
- ✅ Adjust your ROAS targets
- ✅ Add store visits as account default goal (irrelevant - online-only business)

**User had previously disabled these but Google re-enabled them!**

**Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ Disabled ALL 10+ bidding auto-apply settings
2. ✅ Disabled "Add store visits as account default goal"
3. ✅ Kept safe settings: Remove redundant/non-serving keywords
4. ✅ Added monthly reminder to AI-CONTEXT.md to check on 1st of each month

**Why this matters:** With only 2 conversions, automated bidding would waste budget. Manual CPC provides control with limited data.

**Lesson learned:** Google periodically re-enables these settings, especially after UI updates or "optimization" pushes. Must check monthly.

### 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE #2: Keyword Swap Failed

**Yesterday's Solution (Nov 14):**
- Paused: "luxury christmas decor" (0 impressions for 4 days)
- Enabled: "luxury christmas wreaths" at $7.50 bid
- Expected: Dual-keyword strategy restored, 40-60 impressions/day

**Today's Reality (Nov 15):**
- "luxury christmas wreaths" got **0 impressions** at $7.50 bid
- User raised bid to **$12.00** during day - STILL 0 impressions
- "stylish christmas wreaths" got ALL 18 impressions and 3 clicks
- **Keyword swap failed - still single-keyword dependency**

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The problem isn't the keyword text ("decor" vs "wreaths") - it's **Quality Score / Ad Relevance**.

Despite ads having "Luxury Christmas Wreaths" in headlines:
- Landing page `/christmas-wreaths` may not emphasize "luxury" enough
- Ad-to-landing page experience score likely low
- Google determines ad relevance insufficient regardless of bid amount
- $12 bid (67% higher than "stylish" at $7) made no difference

### 📊 Device Performance (Nov 15)

| Device | Impressions | Clicks | CTR | Spend | % of Budget |
|--------|-------------|--------|-----|-------|-------------|
| **Mobile** | 15 | 3 | 20.00% | $19.96 | 100% ✅ |
| Desktop | 3 | 0 | 0% | $0 | 0% ✅ |
| Tablet | 0 | 0 | - | $0 | 0% ✅ |

**Analysis:** Device targeting optimal - all spend on converting device (mobile). -70% desktop/tablet bid adjustments working perfectly.

### 🔍 Search Terms Analysis (Nov 15)

**7 searches triggered ads - ALL RELEVANT:**

1. **"christmas wreath"** - 1 click, $7.85 ✅
2. **"christmas wreaths"** - 1 click, $4.22 ✅
3. **"christmas wreath australia"** - 0 clicks ✅
4. **"xmas door wreaths"** - 0 clicks ✅
5. **"all weather christmas wreath"** - 0 clicks ✅
6. **"christmas wreaths real"** - 0 clicks ✅
7. **"best christmas wreaths"** - 0 clicks ✅

**Waste: 0%** ✅ PERFECT!

**Negative Keywords Update:**
- Added: burlap, nativity, "34th and pine" (3 negatives)
- Decided NOT to add "beach themed" - business has coastal wreath products
- Total negative keywords: **892**

**Quality Assessment:**
- All searches relevant to product
- No competitor brands appearing (tk maxx, zara blocked successfully)
- No wrong products (tablecloth, lights blocked)
- No wrong styles (kitsch, rustic blocked)
- Geographic waste eliminated (perth blocked)

This is TEXTBOOK clean traffic. The negative keyword strategy is working perfectly.

### 📈 GA4 Performance (Nov 15)

**Paid Search:**
- Sessions: 3
- Engaged Sessions: 2 (67% engagement rate) ✅
- Events: 19
- Key Events: 0
- Average Engagement Time: 28.3 seconds

**Organic Search:**
- Sessions: 2

**Direct:**
- Sessions: 1
- Engaged Sessions: 1 (100%)
- Events: 5
- Key Events: 1

**Total Revenue Today:** $0 (no actual purchases across any channel)

**Analysis:** 
- Paid traffic quality acceptable (67% engagement)
- Organic showing key events but those aren't purchases (GA4 confusing terminology)
- No sales today from any source
- 4th consecutive day without Google Ads conversion (last sale: Nov 11)

### 🎯 Active Keywords Status (Nov 15)

**From keyword screenshot verification:**

1. **"luxury christmas wreaths"** (phrase match) - $12.00 bid
   - Nov 15: **0 impressions, 0 clicks** 🔴
   - Status: Eligible but not serving
   - Issue: Quality Score preventing serving despite highest bid

2. **"stylish christmas wreaths"** (phrase match) - $7.00 bid
   - Nov 15: **18 impressions, 3 clicks, $19.96 spend** ✅
   - Status: Serving consistently
   - Performance: Only active keyword, 100% of traffic

**Paused Keywords (verified from screenshot):**
- "christmas gifts" (broad) - $0.30 bid
- "christmas decorations" (broad) - $4.00 bid
- "christmas" (broad) - $1.20 bid
- 39+ other keywords paused

### 📊 5-Day Performance Trend

| Date | Imps | Clicks | CTR | CPC | Spend | Active Keywords | Conversions |
|------|------|--------|-----|-----|-------|----------------|-------------|
| Nov 11 (Tue) | 78 | 14 | 17.95% | $5.92 | $82.91 | 2 | 1 ($285) ✅ |
| Nov 12 (Wed) | 16 | 5 | 31.25% | $6.84 | $34.19 | 1 | 0 |
| Nov 13 (Thu) | 44 | 6 | 13.64% | $5.14 | $30.86 | 1 | 0 |
| Nov 14 (Fri) | 13 | 3 | 23.08% | $8.54 | $25.61 | 1 | 0 |
| Nov 15 (Sat) | 18 | 3 | 16.67% | $6.65 | $19.96 | 1 | 0 |

**Trend Analysis:**
- **Volume:** UNSTABLE (16 → 44 → 13 → 18) - wild swings with single keyword
- **CPC:** VOLATILE ($6.84 → $5.14 → $8.54 → $6.65) - auction competition fluctuating
- **Spend:** DECLINING ($34.19 → $30.86 → $25.61 → $19.96) - not utilizing $30 budget
- **Keywords:** STUCK at 1 active keyword since Nov 12 (4 days)
- **Conversions:** 0 for 4 consecutive days since Nov 11

**What This Means:**
- Single keyword = unpredictable daily performance
- Can't maintain consistent $30/day spend with this volume
- Dual-keyword strategy attempts (Nov 13-15) all failed
- Volume trending down not up (44 → 13 → 18)

### 📈 Financial Reality Check

**Campaign Performance to Date (Nov 10-15, 6 days):**
- **Total Spend:** ~$181
  - Nov 10-11: ~$83/day × 2 = $166 (at $84/day budget)
  - Nov 12: $34.19
  - Nov 13: $30.86
  - Nov 14: $25.61
  - Nov 15: $19.96
  - **Actual total:** $276.62

**Sales:** 2 conversions
- Nov 10: $185 (from "stylish christmas wreaths")
- Nov 11: $285 (from "luxury christmas decor" click Nov 9)
- **Total Revenue:** $470

**Current ROI:** 
- Revenue: $470
- Spend: $276.62
- Profit: $193.38
- **ROI: +70%** (still profitable!)

**30 Days Remaining (Nov 16 - Dec 15):**
- Budget: $900 ($30/day × 30)
- Already spent: $276.62
- Total campaign budget: $1,176.62
- Need: 6-7 more sales at $185 avg = $1,110-1,295 revenue
- Target: 1 sale every 4-5 days

**Reality Check:**
- Days since last sale: 4 (Nov 12, 13, 14, 15)
- Currently: BEHIND PACE (need 1 sale every 4-5 days, currently 0 in 4)
- Volume: Insufficient (18 imps/day won't generate 1 sale/4 days)
- Action needed: Either increase volume OR accept lower targets

### 🎯 Key Insights & Learnings

**1. Quality Score Cannot Be Overcome with Bid Alone**
- "Luxury christmas wreaths" got 0 impressions at $12.00 (71% higher than working keyword)
- $7.50 → $12.00 bid increase had ZERO effect
- Problem is ad relevance, not bid competitiveness
- Lesson: Quality Score issues require content changes, not just budget

**2. Google Auto-Apply Settings Require Monthly Monitoring**
- Google re-enabled 10+ bidding auto-apply settings without notification
- Would have switched campaign to automated bidding
- With only 2 conversions, automated bidding = budget waste
- Added monthly reminder: Check on 1st of every month

**3. Single-Keyword Campaigns Have Severe Limitations**
- Volume unpredictability (16 → 44 → 13 → 18 impressions)
- Budget underspend ($19.96 vs $30 target)
- No backup if keyword performance degrades
- Impression share stuck <10% (losing 90%+ auctions)

**4. Negative Keywords Strategy Working Perfectly**
- 892 negative keywords blocking all waste
- 0% waste for 2nd consecutive day
- All search terms relevant and high-quality
- No competitor brands, wrong products, or geographic waste

**5. Weekend Performance May Differ**
- Nov 15 (Saturday) data represents first weekend day
- Luxury buyers may shop more on weekends
- Small volume (18 imps) makes patterns hard to detect
- Need Sunday data to assess weekend vs weekday

### ✅ ACTIONS TAKEN TODAY (Nov 15, Late Afternoon)

### ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS FOR TONIGHT (Nov 15, 10 PM)

**Check #1: Are New Keywords Serving?**
- Go to Keywords tab in Google Ads
- Filter by "Added today"
- Check Status column: "Eligible" vs "Eligible (Limited)" vs "Low search volume"
- Note which keywords got impressions (if any)

**Check #2: Spend Rate**
- Total spend by 10 PM (should be ~$25-30 if keywords serving)
- Are we utilizing the $40 budget better?
- CPC staying in $5-7 range?

**Check #3: Search Terms**
- Any new search terms from new keywords?
- Traffic quality still 0% waste?
- Any negative keywords needed?

### ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS FOR NOV 16 (TOMORROW)

**Morning (9-10 AM) - CRITICAL CHECKS:**

1. **Weekend Volume Assessment** ⏰ PRIORITY
   - Saturday total impressions (target: 40-60 with new keywords)
   - Which new keywords served? Performance of each
   - Is "stylish christmas wreaths" still getting traffic?
   - Total spend vs $40 budget

2. **New Keywords Status** ⏰
   - How many of 5 are serving?
   - CTR on each keyword
   - Any conversions overnight?
   - Quality Score visible yet? (takes 24-48hrs)

3. **Auto-Apply Settings Verification** ⏰
   - Confirm all bidding auto-apply settings still OFF
   - Check if Google re-enabled anything overnight
   - Document current state

**Evening (6-8 PM) - Full Weekend Assessment:**

1. **Volume Analysis**
   - Saturday + Sunday impressions combined
   - Compare to weekday average (18-25 imps/day)
   - Determine if weekend has higher volume

2. **Conversion Watch**
   - Check for any sales (5th day without conversion is critical)
   - Review GA4 for engagement signals
   - Monitor Direct traffic for returning visitors (conversion lag pattern)

3. **Budget Utilization**
   - Spending pattern: ~$20/day vs $30 budget
   - Can't scale if can't spend existing budget
   - May need to accept $20/day is maximum with current volume

### 🎯 Strategic Decision Point

**Three Paths Forward:**

**Option A: Accept Reality & Optimize for Single Keyword** (Recommended)
- "Stylish christmas wreaths" is the ONLY working keyword
- Reduce budget to $20/day to match actual volume
- Stop trying to force "luxury" keywords to serve
- Target: 1 sale every 5-7 days = 5-6 more sales by Dec 15
- Focus effort on other marketing channels (SEO, social, email)

**Pros:**
- Working with reality, not fighting it
- 0% waste = maximum efficiency
- Profitable at current pace (+70% ROI)
- Less stress, more sustainable

**Cons:**
- Limited scale (can't hit 10-12 sale target)
- Single point of failure if keyword stops working
- <10% impression share = missing 90% of market

**Option B: Create Separate "Luxury" Ad Group** (Time-Intensive)
- New ad group: "Luxury Christmas Keywords"
- Write 10+ new ads with "luxury" in every headline
- Create dedicated luxury landing page with premium messaging
- Move "luxury christmas wreaths" to new ad group
- Separate budget: $10/day for testing

**Pros:**
- Might solve Quality Score issue with dedicated content
- Could unlock 20-30 additional impressions/day
- Professional approach to ad relevance problem

**Cons:**
- 3-5 hours setup time
- May still not work if landing page is the issue
- Testing budget may not convert
- Only 30 days left in season

**Option C: Test Entirely Different Keywords** (Risky)
- "premium christmas wreaths australia"
- "handmade christmas wreaths melbourne"
- "designer christmas wreaths sydney"
- "artificial christmas wreaths luxury"
- Each at $5-6 bid, phrase match

**Pros:**
- Fresh keywords might not have Quality Score baggage
- Could find another winner like "stylish"
- Geographic variants might perform better

**Cons:**
- Unknown performance = gambling budget
- Time to test and optimize (7-10 days)
- Only 30 days left in season
- May waste $100-200 in testing

### 💡 Recommended Strategy: Option A

**Rationale:**
1. ✅ You have a working, profitable keyword (70% ROI overall)
2. ✅ Traffic is 0% waste = perfect efficiency
3. ✅ 30 days remaining = too late for major experiments
4. ✅ Single keyword generating $20/day spend = right-sized
5. ✅ Current pace = 5-6 more sales realistic ($925-1,110 revenue)

**Implementation:**
- Keep "stylish christmas wreaths" at $7.00 bid
- Accept $20-25/day spend as maximum with current volume
- Monitor daily for any degradation in performance
- Focus on landing page conversion rate (current traffic quality is excellent)
- Supplement with other marketing channels

**Expected Results (Nov 16 - Dec 15, 30 days):**
- Spend: $20/day × 30 = $600
- Sales: 5-6 more (at 1 sale per 5-6 days)
- Revenue: $925-1,110 (at $185 avg)
- Total campaign: 7-8 sales, $1,395-1,580 revenue, $876 spend
- **Final ROI: +59-80%** (profitable season)

### 📝 Negative Keywords Status

**Added Today:**
- burlap
- nativity
- "34th and pine"

**NOT Added (Intentional):**
- "beach themed" - Business sells coastal wreaths, this is relevant

**Total Negative Keywords:** 892

**Categories Blocked:**
- ✅ Competitor brands (tk maxx, zara, laura ashley, david jones, harrods)
- ✅ Wrong products (tablecloth, lights, ornaments, baubles)
- ✅ Wrong styles (kitsch, rustic, burlap, farmhouse)
- ✅ Geographic waste (perth)
- ✅ Size-focused (big, large, giant)
- ✅ DIY/cheap modifiers

**Result:** 0% waste achieved for 2nd consecutive day

### 🎯 Weekend Hypothesis to Test

**Theory:** Luxury buyers shop more on weekends (Sat-Sun)

**Evidence to collect:**
- Saturday (Nov 15): 18 impressions
- Sunday (Nov 16): Expected 25-40 impressions if hypothesis correct
- Weekday average: 16-25 impressions

**If weekend volume is 50%+ higher:**
- Consider dayparting: Increase bids Fri-Sun
- Focus budget on high-converting days
- Monday bid reduction to conserve budget

**If weekend volume is similar/lower:**
- No day-of-week pattern
- Keep bids consistent 7 days/week
- Volume limited by keyword, not timing

### 📊 Landing Page Performance

| Landing Page | Impressions | Clicks | CTR |
|--------------|-------------|--------|-----|
| /christmas-wreaths | 25 | 3 | 12.00% |
| /clearance | 17 | 0 | 0% |
| /christmas-candle-holders-centrepieces | 15 | 0 | 0% |
| /floral-arrangements | 8 | 0 | 0% |
| /all-year-collection | 4 | 0 | 0% |

**Analysis:**
- Christmas wreaths page getting clicks ✅
- Other collections showing for searches but not clicking
- Possibly broad match variants or Dynamic Search Ads interference
- Primary landing page is correct and working

### 🔥 Campaign Health Status

**✅ What's Working:**
- Traffic quality: 0% waste (perfect!)
- Device targeting: 100% mobile (where conversions happen)
- Negative keywords: 892 blocking all waste
- Profitability: +70% ROI overall
- Budget control: Manual CPC preventing overspend
- Landing page: Clicks going to right page

**🔴 What's Broken:**
- Volume: Only 18 impressions/day (critically low)
- Keywords: Single keyword for 4 days (high risk)
- "Luxury" keywords: All failed to serve (<$12 bid insufficient)
- Conversions: 0 for 4 days (last sale Nov 11)
- Budget: Can't spend $30/day (only $19.96 today)
- Impression share: <10% (losing 90%+ of auctions)

**⚠️ Critical Risks:**
- Single keyword dependency (if "stylish" stops working, campaign dies)
- Volume insufficient to hit 10-12 sale target
- 4 days without conversion = need sale in next 2-3 days
- Google trying to hijack bidding strategy (auto-apply settings)

### 🎯 Success Criteria for Nov 16-17 (Weekend)

**Minimum Success:**
- ✅ Total weekend impressions: 40+ (Sat + Sun)
- ✅ Weekend clicks: 6-8 total
- ✅ Spend: $40-50 for weekend
- ✅ 0% waste maintained

**Good Success:**
- ✅ Weekend volume 50% higher than weekdays
- ✅ "Luxury christmas wreaths" starts serving (even 1 impression)
- ✅ CTR stays above 15%
- ✅ 1 key event in GA4 (engagement signal)

**Outstanding Success:**
- ✅ 1 CONVERSION on weekend (break 4-day drought)
- ✅ 60+ impressions over Sat-Sun
- ✅ Both keywords serving
- ✅ Revenue: $185-300

### 💬 User Questions Answered Today

**Q: "Why so poor attention to details when reading the repository files and reports?"**
**A:** Valid criticism. Agent jumped to analysis before reading context files, made assumptions, had to be corrected multiple times. Lesson learned: Always read AI-CONTEXT.md and latest minutes FIRST.

**Q: "You don't remember context between chats, right?"**
**A:** Correct. Each conversation is fresh. User should prompt: "Read workspace context first, then analyze these reports."

**Q: "'Stylish christmas wreaths' is enabled and had clicks today, right?"**
**A:** YES - Verified from keyword screenshot. It got ALL 18 impressions and 3 clicks. Only active keyword.

**Q: "Negative keywords added?"**
**A:** YES - Added burlap, nativity, "34th and pine". Decided NOT to add "beach themed" because business has coastal wreaths.

**Q: "I set CPC to $12 for 'luxury christmas wreaths' keyword?"**
**A:** YES - But still got 0 impressions. Quality Score issue, not bid issue. Bid increase from $7.50 → $12 had no effect.

**Q: "What about 'Organic traffic converting (5 sales today)'?"**
**A:** CLARIFIED - GA4 shows 5 "key events" not 5 purchases. Key events = add_to_cart, begin_checkout, etc. Actual revenue across all channels today = $0.

**Q: "I decided to stay on $30 a day?"**
**A:** CONFIRMED - Budget stays at $30/day. Reality is campaign only spending $19.96 with current volume (67% utilization).

**Q: "Today Google switched campaign to maximise conversions from Manual CPC. How do I stop this automatic switch?"**
**A:** RESOLVED - Found Google re-enabled 10+ auto-apply recommendation settings. All disabled. Added monthly reminder to check on 1st of each month. Campaign stayed on Manual CPC (no actual auto-switch happened yet).

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**What Happened Today:**
- Slight volume improvement (13 → 18 impressions, +38%)
- CPC decreased (−22% = better cost efficiency)
- Keyword swap completely failed ("luxury christmas wreaths" got 0 impressions at $12 bid)
- Discovered Google re-enabled auto-apply bidding settings (crisis averted)
- Added 3 negative keywords (892 total)
- Traffic quality perfect (0% waste, all relevant searches)
- Zero conversions (4th consecutive day)

**Critical Discovery:**
Google had re-enabled 10+ auto-apply settings that could have automatically switched bidding strategy from Manual CPC to automated bidding. This would have wasted budget with only 2 conversions. All settings now disabled with monthly reminder added.

**Keyword Swap Post-Mortem:**
Nov 14 solution (swap "luxury christmas decor" → "luxury christmas wreaths") failed. Despite perfect ad match and $12 bid (71% higher than working keyword), got 0 impressions for 2nd day. Problem is Quality Score/landing page experience, not keyword choice or bid amount.

**Single-Keyword Reality:**
Campaign has run on "stylish christmas wreaths" ONLY for 4 consecutive days (Nov 12-15). All attempts to activate second keyword have failed. Volume limited to 15-25 impressions/day with this single keyword.

**Financial Status:**
- Campaign profitable overall: +70% ROI ($470 revenue, $276 spend)
- But declining: 0 sales in 4 days (last sale Nov 11)
- Need sale in next 2-3 days to stay on pace for season target
- Current spend rate: $20/day (can't utilize full $30 budget)

**Bottom Line:**
Campaign is functional and profitable but severely volume-constrained by single-keyword dependency. "Luxury" keyword optimization has failed repeatedly. Recommend accepting single-keyword reality, optimizing for that keyword, and focusing effort on other marketing channels for additional volume.

**Grade Justification (C-):**
- Volume improved slightly (+38% impressions) ✅
- CPC decreased (−22%) ✅
- Traffic quality perfect (0% waste) ✅
- But keyword swap failed completely ❌
- Still single-keyword dependent ❌
- 4 days without conversion ❌
- Can't spend full budget ❌
- Google tried to hijack bidding ❌

## 🚀 END OF DAY UPDATE (Nov 15, Late Afternoon)

- ✅ Added 5 new keyword variations ($5-6 bids, phrase match)
- ✅ Increased budget to $40/day (weekend test)

**STRATEGY SHIFT:**
- From: Single keyword dependency ("stylish christmas wreaths" only)

- Theory: Failed "luxury" keywords had baggage; fresh terms may serve
- Weekend test window: Nov 15-17 (Sat-Sun)

**NEXT CHECKPOINTS:**

**EXPECTED OUTCOMES:**
- Best case: 2-3 keywords serving, 40-60 imps/weekend, 1 sale
- Realistic: 1-2 keywords active, 30-40 imps/weekend, no sale but data
- Worst case: Keywords don't serve, back to single-keyword Monday
