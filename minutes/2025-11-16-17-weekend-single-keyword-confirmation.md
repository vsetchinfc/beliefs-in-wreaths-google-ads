## 💡 Key Insights & Learnings

### 1. New Keywords Don't Solve Quality Score Issues

**Hypothesis:** Fresh keywords without Quality Score baggage would serve
**Result:** ❌ Failed - 0 impressions across all 5 keywords
**Reason:** Low search volume or Google still applying Quality Score at account/ad group level

### 2. Weekend Traffic Pattern

**Hypothesis:** Luxury buyers shop more on weekends
**Data:**
- Weekend average: 25.5 imps/day
- Weekday average (Nov 12-15): 22.75 imps/day
- **Difference:** +12% on weekends (slight increase, not significant)

**Conclusion:** Minimal weekend lift. Not enough to justify budget or bid increases.

### 3. Single Keyword Dependency Confirmed

**Reality:**
- Days on single keyword: 6 days (Nov 12-17)
- Attempts to activate second keyword: 5+ failed attempts
- Keywords tested: "luxury christmas decor", "luxury christmas wreaths", 5 new variations
- Success rate: 0%

**Conclusion:** Single keyword strategy is not a choice, it's reality. Accept and optimize for it.

### 4. Budget Utilization Optimal

**Budget:** $30/day
**Actual spend:** $27.54/day average
**Utilization:** 91.8%

This is optimal - spending close to budget without hitting hard cap.

### 5. Traffic Quality Excellent, Volume Insufficient

**Quality indicators:**
- CTR: 13.73% (3-5x industry average)
- Engagement rate: 100%
- Waste: 0% (after negative keyword cleanup)
- Device targeting: 100% mobile (correct)

**Volume reality:**
- 25.5 impressions/day
- 3.5 clicks/day
- <10% impression share (losing 90%+ of auctions)
- Lost IS (budget): >90%

**Conclusion:** Quality perfect, but volume insufficient to hit 10-12 sale target. Need additional traffic sources.
