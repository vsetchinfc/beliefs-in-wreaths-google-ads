## EOD summary (11:00 PM)

### ‚úÖ Strategy validated
- **Hero keywords performing exceptionally:** 30% CTR on "luxury christmas wreath" and "luxury christmas decor" confirms luxury-only strategy is correct.
- **CTR improvement:** Overall 10.46% (up from 9.60% baseline) with higher quality clicks.
- **Budget throttling persists:** Lost IS (budget) at 85.16% ‚Äî still main constraint. Slight improvement (was 86.22%) but expect slow gains with $25-35/day budget.
- **CPC increase expected:** Avg CPC rose to $2.71 from $2.00 as higher bids take effect. This is intentional ‚Äî paying for higher-intent traffic.

### ‚è≥ Waiting for full activation
- "High end christmas wreath" re-enabled at $5.00 but 0 impressions yet (needs 12-24 hours)
- Centrepiece keywords with raised $4.75 bids not serving yet (low search volume, needs time)
- "Luxury christmas wreaths" (plural) at $4.50 not serving yet

### üéØ Key wins today
1. Re-enabled historically strong "high end christmas wreath" (20% CTR, 2 conv history)
2. Raised bids on 6 hero keywords ‚Äî 2 already showing 30% CTR within hours
3. Added 50+ campaign-level negatives to block waste (DIY, marketplaces, wrong intent)
4. Confirmed ad/LP relevance is strong (10.46% CTR validates quality score)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Watch items for Nov 2
- **GA4 add_to_cart alert:** 0 ATC events after 70+ clicks total. If still 0 after 100+ clicks = LP/value issue, not keyword targeting.
- **Impression Share:** Still <10% overall. If hero keywords stay <20% IS after 24 hours, may need another +$0.25 bid boost OR accept budget reality.
- **Search Terms:** Check 2-3x daily first week; add negatives immediately if any waste appears.

### Questions to answer

2. Did 30% CTR on hero keywords sustain through full day Nov 1?
3. Did centrepiece keywords get impressions with new $4.75 bids?
4. Is Impression Share improving on hero terms (goal: 20%+)?
5. Daily spend pacing correctly within $25-35 range?
6. Any waste in Search Terms report ‚Üí need more negatives?
7. Any GA4 add_to_cart signals yet (threshold: 0 after 100+ clicks = flag LP review)?

### Possible actions for Nov 2
- If hero keywords still <20% IS: consider +$0.25 bid boost OR accept budget constraint
- If "high end christmas wreath" still 0 imps: check quality score, landing page assignment
- If centrepiece keywords still 0 imps after 24 hours: may be too specific (acceptable for longtail)
- If new waste in Search Terms: add negatives immediately
- Weekend monitoring lighter; full Week 1 review Monday Nov 4

## Notes and lessons learned
- **30% CTR is exceptional:** Hero keywords hitting this level proves audience targeting is perfect. Low click volume (4-5 clicks) is acceptable.
- **Budget throttling is the real ceiling:** Lost IS (budget) at 85% means we're losing 6x impressions. Raising bids helps win more within budget but won't 10x traffic.
- **Centrepieces are less competitive:** Centrepieces RSA consistently 10% CTR vs 8-9% for wreaths, lower CPC ($2.37 vs $3.22). Opportunity niche.
- **Low volume keywords expected:** "Not eligible - rarely served" status on luxury longtail terms is normal. They'll trigger for close variants when searched.
- **Quality over quantity confirmed:** Would rather have 4 clicks at 30% CTR ($20 cost) than 20 clicks at 5% CTR ($40 cost) with wrong intent.
- **GA4 tracking works but 0 conversions yet:** Add_to_cart, begin_checkout events configured correctly but not firing. Needs monitoring ‚Äî if 0 ATC after 100+ clicks = potential LP/pricing/value prop issue (not targeting issue).

**Status:** EOD complete. Sleep until Nov 2 evening. Next checkpoint: Nov 2 reports to assess full-day Nov 1 impact and overnight Nov 2 start.
