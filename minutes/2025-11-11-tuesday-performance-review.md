## Why Reduce to $30/Day?

### ❌ Problems at $84/Day:
1. **77.5% waste spend** - Most budget going to wrong searches
2. **Low search volume** - Only 78 impressions despite $83 spend
3. **Budget exhaustion** - Hero keyword stopped serving after 2 PM
4. **Not sustainable** - Can't afford $84/day long-term ($2,520/month)
5. **Single sale days** - Need multiple sales to justify $84/day

### ✅ Benefits of $30/Day:
1. **Sustainability** - $900/month manageable
2. **Forced focus** - Budget constraint = only best keywords
3. **Profitability math** - 12 sales × $200 avg = $2,400 revenue - $900 spend = $1,500 profit
4. **34 days remaining** - Need consistent daily performance, not boom/bust
5. **Tighter control** - Less budget = less room for waste

## Action Items for Tomorrow (Nov 12)

### Immediate (Before Campaign Starts):
1. ✅ PAUSE "luxury christmas wreath" (singular)
2. ✅ PAUSE "luxury christmas wreaths" (plural)
3. ✅ REDUCE daily budget to $30.00
4. ✅ Verify negative keywords active
5. ✅ Confirm device bids: Mobile +20%, Desktop/Tablet -70%

### Monitoring Schedule:

- **Lunch (12-1 PM):** Mid-day check - impressions, clicks, waste terms
- **Evening (6-8 PM):** Full day review - conversions, spend, performance

### Decision Points:
- If $30 budget exhausted by 2 PM → May need to increase to $40-50
- If waste continues → Add more exact match negative keywords
- If 0 impressions → Bids may be too low for competitive auctions
- If conversion(s) → Validate strategy, continue at $30/day
