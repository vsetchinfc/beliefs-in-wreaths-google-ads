**This should FINALLY hit your $25/day target!**

---

## 🎉 POSITIVE DISCOVERIES

## ⚠️ CONCERNING PATTERNS

### 1. Competitor searches eating 30% of budget
**$21.78 spent on:**
- David Jones (2 clicks, $9.46)
- Harrods (1 click, $3.47)
- Harris Scarfe (1 click, $1.49)
- Holly and Ivy store (1 click, $4.87)
- Dancer and Dasher store (1 click, $4.37)

**Why this is bad:**
- People looking for specific retail brands, not your artisan products
- High CPC but low conversion intent (just browsing brands)
- Comparison shoppers, not luxury buyers

**Solution:** Block all retail/competitor brand names

---

### 2. Brand store searches (16% of waste)
Ashland, brand stores = people looking for mass-market products
**Solution:** Block all brand names in negative list above

---

### 3. DIY/Making searches (0 clicks but 7 impressions wasted)
Your luxury positioning conflicts with DIY intent
**Solution:** Block all making/craft terms

---
