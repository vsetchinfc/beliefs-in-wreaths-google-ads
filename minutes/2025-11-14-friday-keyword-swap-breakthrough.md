# 📅 NOV 14, 2025 (FRIDAY) - KEYWORD SWAP BREAKTHROUGH

## 🎯 CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Ad/Keyword Mismatch Solved

**Grade: C** (Critical issue identified and resolved, but volume still collapsed)

### Campaign Performance Summary

| Metric | Today | Yesterday (Nov 13) | Change |
|--------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| **Spend** | $25.61 | $30.86 | -17% |
| **Impressions** | 13 | 44 | -70% ⚠️ |
| **Clicks** | 3 | 6 | -50% |
| **CTR** | 23.08% | 13.64% | +69% |
| **Avg CPC** | $8.54 | $5.14 | +66% ⚠️ |
| **Conversions** | 0 | 0 | - |
| **Search Impression Share** | <10% | ~10% | -0% 🔴 |
| **Lost IS (budget)** | >90% | >90% | - |

### 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

**1. VOLUME COLLAPSED 70%** (44 → 13 impressions)
- Only "stylish christmas wreaths" serving (10 impressions)
- "Luxury christmas decor" STILL 0 impressions (4th consecutive day: Nov 11, 12, 13, 14)
- Single keyword dependency = catastrophic vulnerability
- <10% impression share = losing 90%+ of auctions

**2. ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED: Ad/Keyword Relevance Mismatch**

After reviewing ad preview links, identified the problem:

**The "Luxury Christmas Decor" Issue:**
- **Keyword:** "luxury christmas **decor**" (broad term - includes ornaments, trees, lights, tablecloths)
- **Ad Headlines:** 15+ variations ALL say "**wreaths**" (only 1 says "decor")
  - "Luxury Christmas Wreaths"
  - "Browse Our Wreath Collection"
  - "High Quality Christmas Wreaths"
  - "Personalise Your Wreath"
  - "Artificial Christmas Wreaths"
  - "Custom Made Christmas Wreaths"
  - etc.
- **Landing Page:** /christmas-wreaths (specific product, not general decor)
- **Google's Assessment:** Low Ad Relevance = Low Quality Score = Won't show ad regardless of bid

**Evidence:**
- 4 consecutive days at 0 impressions (Nov 11-14)
- Bid increases had no effect: $4.50 → $6.00 → $7.50 → still 0 impressions
- All ads focus on "wreaths" while keyword says "decor" = mismatch

**3. CPC INCREASED 66%** ($5.14 → $8.54)
- Competing in more expensive auctions with lower volume
- Single keyword = less auction participation
- Quality searches cost more ("34th and pine" brand = $8.92)

### ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: KEYWORD SWAP

**Action Taken (Nov 14 evening):**

1. ❌ **PAUSED:** "luxury christmas decor" ($7.50 bid)
   - Reason: Ad relevance mismatch causing 4-day blackout
   - Can't compete with wreath-focused ads for "decor" searches

2. ✅ **ENABLED:** "luxury christmas wreaths" (plural) ($7.50 bid)
   - Previously paused at $4.50
   - Perfect match with all wreath-focused ad copy
   - Should start serving immediately
   - Maintains luxury positioning

**Why This Will Work:**
- Keyword "wreaths" matches ad headlines perfectly
- Landing page /christmas-wreaths = exact match
- Historical performance: This keyword existed before, likely contributed to Nov 11 $285 sale
- Expected: Immediate impression recovery within 2-4 hours

**Expected Impact:**
- Restore dual-keyword strategy (2 active keywords instead of 1)
- Recover 20-30 impressions/day from "luxury" keyword
- Total daily volume: 40-60 impressions (vs 13 today)
- Lower CPC as auction participation increases
- Impression share: <10% → 15-20%

### 📊 Device Performance (Nov 14)

| Device | Impressions | Clicks | CTR | Spend | % of Budget |
|--------|------------|--------|-----|-------|-------------|
| **Mobile** | 11 | 3 | 27.27% | $25.61 | 100% ✅ |
| Desktop | 2 | 0 | 0% | $0 | 0% ✅ |
| Tablet | 0 | 0 | - | $0 | 0% ✅ |

**Analysis:** Device targeting optimal - all spend on converting device (mobile).

### 🔍 Search Terms Analysis (Nov 14)

**6 total searches triggering ads:**

1. **"34th and pine"** - 1 click, $8.92, 100% CTR
   - Home decor luxury brand search
   - Wrong intent (looking for competitor)
   - **Action:** Consider adding "34th and pine" as negative

2. **"beach themed christmas wreath"** - 0 clicks
   - Wrong style (coastal vs luxury)
   - **Action:** Add "beach themed" as negative

3. **"christmas wreath for double doors"** - 0 clicks
   - Relevant product but poor targeting quality
   - Size-focused not luxury-focused

4. **"burlap christmas wreath"** - 0 clicks
   - Rustic/budget style (opposite of luxury)
   - **Action:** Add "burlap" as negative

5. **"nativity wreath"** - 0 clicks
   - Religious theme, wrong product type
   - **Action:** Add "nativity" as negative

6. **"christmas wreath"** - 0 clicks
   - Generic search
   - Acceptable waste at low volume

**Waste Analysis:**
- 3 clear waste terms identified (beach themed, burlap, nativity)
- 1 competitor brand search (34th and pine)
- 2 acceptable searches (double doors, generic wreath)
- Waste impact: Minimal (0 clicks on waste terms)

**Positive Note:** Yesterday's 11 negative keywords (tk maxx, zara, laura ashley, tablecloth, kitsch, perth, big, large) successfully blocked those waste searches - none appeared today!

### 🎯 Active Keywords Status (After Swap)

**Now Active (2 keywords):**

1. **"stylish christmas wreaths"** - Phrase Match, $7.00 bid ✅
   - Nov 14: 10 impressions, 1 click, $8.27
   - Status: Serving consistently
   - Performance: Proven converter (Nov 10 $185 sale)

2. **"luxury christmas wreaths"** (plural) - Phrase Match, $7.50 bid ✅ NEW
   - Just enabled (Nov 14 evening)
   - Expected: Start serving within 2-4 hours
   - Rationale: Perfect match with wreath-focused ads
   - Previous paused at $4.50, now competitive at $7.50

**Paused Keywords:**

❌ **"luxury christmas decor"** - $7.50 bid - PAUSED (Nov 14)
   - Reason: Ad/keyword mismatch caused 4-day blackout
   - Nov 11-14: 0 impressions despite three bid increases
   - Quality Score issue unresolvable without creating separate ad group

❌ **"luxury christmas wreath"** (singular) - $4.50 bid - PAUSED
   - Low search volume
   - May have contributed to Nov 11 sale but unclear

### 📝 Negative Keywords Added (Recommended for Nov 15)

**Add these 4 negatives tomorrow morning:**

```
burlap
"beach themed"
nativity
"34th and pine"
```

**Total negative keywords:** 888 + 4 = **892**

**Expected impact:** Block 3-4 waste impressions/day

### 🎯 Key Insights & Learnings

**1. Quality Score Matters More Than Bid Amount**
- "Luxury christmas decor" got 0 impressions at $7.50 (4 days straight)
- Root cause: Ad relevance mismatch, not insufficient bid
- Lesson: Can't force a keyword to serve if Quality Score is too low

**2. Ad Copy Must Match Keyword Intent**
- Keyword "decor" (broad) vs Ad "wreaths" (specific) = fail
- Keyword "wreaths" (specific) vs Ad "wreaths" (specific) = success
- Lesson: Tight keyword-ad-landing page alignment essential

**3. Single Keyword Dependency = High Risk**
- Lost 70% volume when only 1 keyword active
- <10% impression share = losing 90%+ of auctions
- Lesson: Need 2+ active keywords for stability

**4. Negative Keywords Take 24 Hours to Work**
- Nov 13: Added tk maxx, zara, laura ashley, etc.
- Nov 14: Zero appearances of those terms = success!
- Lesson: Yesterday's cleanup is paying off today

**5. Historical Analysis Critical for Decisions**
- Reviewed 4 ad preview links to diagnose mismatch
- Confirmed all ads say "wreaths" 95% of the time
- Only 1 headline mentioned "decor" (buried among 15+ wreath headlines)
- Lesson: Visual ad review reveals issues data alone can't show

### ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS FOR NOV 15 (TOMORROW)

### 📊 3-Day Performance Trend

| Date | Imps | Clicks | CTR | CPC | Spend | Active Keywords | Waste % |
|------|------|--------|-----|-----|-------|----------------|---------|
| Nov 12 (Wed) | 16 | 5 | 31.25% | $6.84 | $34.19 | 1 ("stylish" only) | 0% ✅ |
| Nov 13 (Thu) | 44 | 6 | 13.64% | $5.14 | $30.86 | 1 ("stylish" only) | 45% ⚠️ |
| Nov 14 (Fri) | 13 | 3 | 23.08% | $8.54 | $25.61 | 1 ("stylish" only) | 30% |

**Trend Analysis:**
- Volume UNSTABLE (16 → 44 → 13) - wild swings with single keyword
- CPC INCREASING ($6.84 → $5.14 → $8.54) - auction competition intensifying  
- Waste IMPROVING (0% → 45% → 30%) - negatives starting to work
- Budget UNDERSPENDING (114% → 103% → 85%) - not enough volume to spend $30

**What This Means:**
- Single keyword = unpredictable performance
- Need dual-keyword strategy to stabilize
- Keyword swap MUST work or accept <10% impression share forever

### 🎯 Success Criteria for Nov 15

**Minimum Success (Acceptable):**
- ✅ "Luxury christmas wreaths" gets ANY impressions (1+)
- ✅ Total impressions: 25+ (vs 13 today)
- ✅ Both keywords serving some volume
- ✅ Spend: $28-32 (closer to budget)

**Good Success (Target):**
- ✅ "Luxury christmas wreaths" gets 15-25 impressions
- ✅ Total impressions: 40-60
- ✅ CPC drops to $5-7 range
- ✅ Impression share: 15-20% (vs <10% today)
- ✅ Waste: <20%

**Outstanding Success (Hope):**
- ✅ Both keywords serving equally (20-30 imps each)
- ✅ Total impressions: 60-80
- ✅ CPC: $4-5 range
- ✅ Impression share: 20-30%
- ✅ 1 conversion or key event

### 💡 Contingency Plan (If Keyword Swap Fails)

**If "luxury christmas wreaths" gets 0 impressions tomorrow:**

**Option A (Most Likely):**
- Accept single keyword reality
- Focus 100% on "stylish christmas wreaths"
- Lower expectations: 15-25 impressions/day, not 40-60
- Reduce budget to $20/day to match volume
- Target: 1 sale every 4-5 days instead of 2-3 days

**Option B (Nuclear Option):**
- Pause campaign temporarily
- Create new ad group specifically for "luxury" keywords
- Write luxury-focused ad copy with "luxury" in headlines
- Raise bids to $10+ (test Quality Score theory)
- Risk: Time-consuming, may not work

**Option C (Pivot Strategy):**
- Test completely different keyword: "premium christmas wreaths"
- Test "handmade christmas wreaths australia"
- Test "designer christmas wreaths"
- Risk: Unknown performance, burning testing budget

**Recommended:** Try Option A first. Single keyword worked on Nov 10 ($185 sale). Can survive on "stylish" alone if needed.
