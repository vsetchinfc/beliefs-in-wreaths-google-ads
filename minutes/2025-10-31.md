# Daily minutes — 2025-10-31

Participants: Owner (vsetchinfc), Assistant
Campaign: B-in-W [Search | Sales] — AU (Christmas season)
Landing pages:
- Wreaths: https://beliefsinwreaths.com.au/collections/christmas-wreaths
- Centrepieces: https://beliefsinwreaths.com.au/collections/christmas-candle-holders-centrepieces
- All Christmas: https://beliefsinwreaths.com.au/collections/christmas-collection

## Context
- Many generic keywords paused yesterday; today saw zero visits.
- Daily budget recently set to $30–$35; platform spent ~$40 (normal overdelivery).
- Goal: Attract high-intent, high-income shoppers for bespoke products; avoid price shoppers.

## Key observations
- Only luxury-intent terms have converted historically (e.g., "luxury christmas wreath").
- Pausing generics reduced low-quality traffic but also shrank volume too far.
- We need more luxury-intent coverage across all 3 landing pages and stronger bids.

## Decisions today
- Keep daily budget at $25 but concentrate spend on luxury/bespoke intent.
- Expand phrase/exact coverage across 3 landing pages with premium modifiers.
- Add negative keywords to block price/DIY traffic at campaign level.
- Pilot dayparting with conservative bid adjustments; refine with data.

## Action items
1) Keywords — Wreaths (owner)
   - Add Phrase + Exact for: luxury, designer, handcrafted, premium, bespoke, artisan, custom, made to order + "christmas wreath(s)".
   - Bid: $4.00 (Phrase), $4.50–$5.00 (Exact for top terms). Landing: /christmas-wreaths.
2) Keywords — Centrepieces (owner)
   - Add Phrase + Exact: luxury|designer|handcrafted|premium|bespoke + "christmas centrepiece(s)"|"candle holder(s)".
   - Bid: $3.50–$4.50. Landing: /christmas-candle-holders-centrepieces.
3) Keywords — All Christmas (owner)
   - Add Phrase: luxury|designer|premium + "christmas decor"|"christmas collection"|"christmas decorations australia".
   - Bid: $3.00–$3.50. Landing: /christmas-collection.
4) Negatives — Campaign level (owner)
   - Keep/extend: cheap, diy, "how to", tutorial, free, wholesale, bulk, rental, funeral, sympathy, memorial, table, centerpiece, centrepiece, candle (if not relevant to wreath ad group), $20, $30, under 50, budget, kmart, target, amazon, etsy, pinterest, ideas, printable, pattern.
5) Bids & structure (assistant to review post-implementation)
   - Increase winner "luxury christmas wreath" Phrase to $5.00; add Exact at $5.50.
   - Consider new ad groups per landing page for better ad relevance.
6) Ad scheduling (owner)
   - Start: +20% bids 7–10am and 6–10pm; -30% 12–5am. Keep other hours neutral.
   - Reassess with hour-of-day report after 3–5 days.
7) Audiences (owner)
   - Add Observation: In-Market "Home decor", "Seasonal & holiday decor"; Affinity "Luxury shoppers".
   - Apply +10–20% if performance positive.
8) Geo/device (owner)
   - Focus Sydney & Melbourne; +20% city-level bid adj if data supports.
   - Monitor device splits; boost best-performing device by +10–15%.
9) Tracking (owner)
   - Confirm conversions importing since 2025-10-29; verify purchase values.

## Risks & mitigations
- Too little traffic after pruning — Mitigate by expanding premium variants and Exact.
- Price shoppers slipping in — Strengthen negatives and ad messaging (bespoke, luxury).
- Overspend on some days — Normal overdelivery; monthly cap protects total. Monitor daily.

Keywords — notable lines
- Broad “christmas table decorations” (now paused): 235 imps, 23 clicks, AUD 46.47 — drove ~40% of clicks pre-pause; intent too generic for luxury AOV.
- Broad “christmas wreath australia”: 162 imps, 13 clicks, AUD 19.48 — acceptable sculpting broad if kept tightly controlled by negatives.
- Phrase “luxury christmas wreath”: 10 imps, 1 click, AUD 5.25 — high CPC but aligned to target intent.
- Phrase “handmade christmas wreaths”: 34 imps, 2 clicks, AUD 4.92 — good engagement.
- Many luxury phrase/exact variants show “Not eligible — rarely served” (likely low search volume). Expect slow but higher intent.

What we learned today
- Volume and cost were largely driven by generic broad terms (esp. table decorations) before they were paused; zero conversions.
- CTR is healthy (9.6%) — ads/LP relevance look fine. Main blockers: budget throttling (86% Lost IS) and low eligible volume on luxury terms.
- Strategy remains sound: concentrate budget on a small set of high-intent terms and avoid generic discovery.

Decisions/changes going forward
- Keep generic broad paused. If 1 broad stays, use only “christmas wreath australia” with a strong negative list; cap bid ~AUD 1.50–1.80.
- Elevate 6–8 hero terms (Phrase unless noted) and raise bids +AUD 0.25–0.50 to win more auctions:
   - "luxury christmas wreath" (Phrase) → AUD 5.25–5.75
   - "luxury christmas wreaths" (Phrase) → AUD 4.50–5.00
   - "handmade christmas wreaths" (Phrase) → AUD 3.00–3.50
   - "premium christmas wreath" (Phrase) → AUD 3.00–3.50
   - "luxury christmas centrepiece(s)" (Phrase) → AUD 4.25–4.75
   - "luxury christmas candle holder" (Phrase) → AUD 4.25–4.75
   - Optional Exact for the top 2 (“luxury christmas wreath(s)”) at +AUD 0.50 over Phrase.
- Structure hygiene:
   - Wreaths ad group: add ad-group negatives for centrepiece|centrepiece|candle.
   - Centrepieces ad group: add ad-group negative "wreath".
   - Consider splitting ad groups per landing page (already aligned) and keep RSA assets focused.
- Negative safety list (campaign-level add-only) to reduce bargain/DIY/wholesale clicks:
   - cheap, cheapest, budget, under 50, $20, $30, free, diy, "how to", tutorial, ideas, printable, template, pattern, crochet, knitting, paper, svg, pdf, clipart, kmart, target, big w, bunnings, amazon, ebay
- Remove harmful broad geo negatives if present (e.g., sydney, melbourne).

Tomorrow (Nov 1) — what to check
- Impression Share and Top IS on the hero terms; if still <10–20%, add +AUD 0.25 to those bids.
- Search Terms every 4–6 hours; add negatives immediately (protect intent split between wreaths vs centrepieces).
- GA4 add_to_cart / begin_checkout signals; if still 0 after another 60–100 paid clicks, plan LP offer/value-message tweaks.

Owner notes
- Budget currently shows AUD 35/day in report. Keep between AUD 25–35 while consolidating to hero terms. Revisit scaling after stability.
