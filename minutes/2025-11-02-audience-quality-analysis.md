## 2. Geographic Analysis

### Location Breakdown
| Location | Clicks | Impr. | CTR | Avg CPC | Cost | Conversions | Conv Rate |
|----------|--------|-------|-----|---------|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Australia** (national) | 1,419 | 60,673 | 2.34% | $0.79 | $1,125.17 | 2 | 0.14% |

**Critical issue**: **No state/city granularity visible in report.**

**What we need to know:**
- Which states/cities driving conversions? (Sydney Eastern Suburbs? Melbourne Toorak? Brisbane?)
- Are we wasting budget on budget-conscious areas? (Western Sydney? Regional QLD?)
- Should we add +20-30% bid adjustments for wealthy postcodes?

**Action required**:
→ **Pull State/City location report** from Google Ads → Locations tab → Select "Where people were" → Download CSV
→ Look for: Sydney (2000-2010, Mosman, Double Bay), Melbourne (3142 Toorak, 3161 Caulfield), Brisbane (4006 Fortitude Valley)

**Quality verdict**: **5/10** — Can't assess without granular data. National targeting too broad for $150-300 luxury product.

## 4. Device Analysis

### Device Breakdown
| Device | Clicks | Impr. | CTR | Avg CPC | Cost | Conversions | % of Traffic |
|--------|--------|-------|-----|---------|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Mobile** | 1,199 | 47,052 | **2.55%** | $0.78 | $940.32 | **2** | **84%** 🔥 |
| Computers | 111 | 6,580 | 1.69% | $1.07 | $118.43 | 0 | 8% |
| Tablets | 109 | 6,894 | 1.58% | $0.61 | $66.42 | 0 | 8% |
| TV screens | 0 | 3 | 0% | — | $0 | 0 | 0% |

**Critical findings:**
- 🔥 **Mobile dominates**: 84% of clicks, 2 conversions (both from mobile!)
- ⚠️ **Desktop NOT converting**: 111 clicks, $118 cost, 0 conversions = mobile-only buyer behavior
- ✅ **Mobile CPC lower**: $0.78 vs desktop $1.07 = more efficient

**BUT**: Mobile has **POOR LANDING PAGE EXPERIENCE** based on previous sessions:
- Images likely not optimized for mobile
- Trust signals buried below fold
- Payment options (Afterpay) not visible
- Price shock without anchoring

**Quality verdict**: **6/10** — Right device (mobile luxury shoppers), but LP not optimized for mobile = losing conversions.

**Action required**:
→ Implement mobile-first luxury homepage mockup (price anchoring at top, trust bar, Afterpay logo visible)
→ Test: Speed up mobile page load (compress images, lazy loading)
→ Consider: +10% mobile bid adjustment IF LP improved

## 5. Landing Page Performance

### Landing Page Breakdown
| Landing Page | Clicks | Impr. | CTR | Avg CPC | Cost | % Traffic |
|--------------|--------|-------|-----|---------|------|-----------|
| **/christmas-collection** | 781 | 50,425 | 1.55% | $0.52 | $408.20 | **55%** |
| **/christmas-wreaths** | 478 | 6,211 | **7.70%** | $1.25 | $596.46 | **34%** |
| **/christmas-candle-holders-centrepieces** | 137 | 9,075 | 1.51% | $0.64 | $88.16 | 10% |
| **/clearance** | 20 | 2,963 | 0.67% | $1.43 | $28.66 | 1% |

**Insights:**
- ✅ **Christmas wreaths page = hero**: 7.70% CTR (3x higher than collection), $596 of $1,125 cost (53%)
- ⚠️ **Collection page waste**: 55% of traffic but only 1.55% CTR = generic, low-intent traffic
- ✅ **Centrepieces underperforming**: Only 10% of traffic despite having keywords

**Critical issue**: **WHERE DID THE 2 CONVERSIONS HAPPEN?** (GA4 doesn't show LP source in these reports)

**Action required**:
→ Pull GA4 "Landing page + source/medium" report filtered to "Paid Search" to see which LP converted
→ If christmas-wreaths converted: Focus 70% budget there, lower centrepieces
→ If collection page converted: Something's wrong (1.55% CTR shouldn't convert)

---

## 6. Household Income Analysis

**MISSING**: No household income data in provided reports.

**What we need**:
- Google Ads → Audiences → Demographics → **"Household Income" tab**
- Look for: "Top 10%", "11-20%", "21-30%" brackets
- Goal: Confirm 50%+ of clicks from Top 10-20% earners (affluent luxury buyers)

**If income data shows low earners dominating**:
→ Add bid adjustments: +30% for "Top 10%", +20% for "11-20%", -30% for "Lower 50%"
→ May explain 0 conversion problem (right age, wrong income level)

**Quality verdict**: **N/A** — Can't assess without data.

1. **Geographic blind spot**: No state/city data = can't optimize for wealthy suburbs
2. **Waste terms present**: "xmas lights", "christmas shack", "big w" searches eating $6-8
3. **Mobile LP not optimized**: 1,199 clicks but only 2 conversions = 0.17% conv rate (should be 1-2%)
4. **"Unknown" age group**: 29% of budget to unidentified demographic (likely cookie blocking)
5. **Desktop dead weight**: 111 clicks, $118, 0 conversions = wrong device strategy
6. **No income validation**: Can't confirm Top 10-20% earners without household income report

### Priority 3: Mobile Landing Page Optimization (Next Week)
Based on mobile = 84% traffic + 100% conversions:
1. Implement luxury homepage mockup (price anchoring at top)

3. Add Afterpay logo to hero section (mobile visibility)
4. Compress images for mobile load speed
5. Add "Tap to WhatsApp" button for mobile shoppers (luxury service)

### Priority 4: Geographic Bid Adjustments (After Report)
Once we get State/City data:
- **Sydney Eastern Suburbs** (2000-2010, Mosman, Vaucluse): +30% bid adjustment

## Expected Impact After Optimizations

**Current**: 1,419 clicks, $1,125 cost, 2 conversions = 0.14% conv rate, $562 CPA

**After optimizations**:
- Negatives added: Save $5-10/day (block waste)
- Mobile LP improved: 0.17% → 1-2% conv rate (10x improvement)
- Geographic bid adjustments: +20-30% for wealthy suburbs = better quality clicks
- Hero keyword expansion: More "luxury" volume at 25-50% CTR

**Target metrics (Week 2)**:
- Conv rate: 0.14% → **1.5-2%** (mobile LP + waste blocked)
- CPA: $562 → **$150-200** (efficiency from LP improvements)
- Conversions: 2 → **5-8** (same budget, higher conv rate)

---

## Conclusion

**Audience quality is GOOD (7.5/10)**, but needs refinement:
- ✅ Right age (45-65+)
- ✅ Right intent (luxury keywords converting)
- ✅ Right device (mobile)
- ⚠️ Missing geographic targeting (wealthy suburbs)
- ⚠️ Mobile LP killing conversions (0.17% conv rate too low)
- ⚠️ Some waste terms bleeding budget

**The 0 conversion problem is NOT audience quality** — it's:
1. **Mobile landing page experience** (84% mobile but LP not optimized)
2. **Price shock** (no luxury positioning on LP to match $150-300 ads)
3. **Trust signals buried** (handmade, Australian, bespoke not visible above fold)

**Fix mobile LP first**, then expand hero keywords. Geographic targeting second. Audience quality is already strong.
