## Keywords NOT Serving (Despite Raised Bids)

### Still 0 Impressions:

## RSA Ad Performance

| Ad | Imps | Clicks | CTR | Cost | % of Spend |

## GA4 Analytics (Oct 31 - Nov 2)

### Paid Search:
- **25 sessions**, 16 engaged (64% engagement rate)
- Average engagement time: 32.56s
- **208 total events**
- **0 key events** (purchases) 🔴
- **0 add_to_cart events** 🔴

### Critical Alert:
**0 add_to_cart after 37 clicks / 25 sessions**

This is NOT a targeting problem (hero keywords have 27-31% CTR = perfect intent).
This IS a landing page/offer/price problem:
- Value prop unclear?
- Price shock ($150-300)?
- Poor mobile experience?
- CTA not compelling?
- Trust signals missing?

**Action:** Need landing page audit ASAP.

## $25/Day Budget Optimization Plan

### Problem Statement:
- **Current:** $36/day average spend
- **Target:** $25/day budget limit
- **Required reduction:** ~$11/day (30% cut)

### Root Cause:
- Budget drainer: "christmas wreath australia" (Broad) eating $8/day with 7% CTR
- Hero keywords too expensive at $5.00 bids (but performing amazingly)

---

## Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Execute Today)

#### 1. ✅ PAUSE Budget Drainer:
**"christmas wreath australia" (Broad Match)**
- Currently spending ~$8/day
- CTR only 7.14% (vs 27-31% on hero keywords)

#### 2. ✅ Lower Hero Keyword Bids (Slight Reduction):
Hero keywords have 27-31% CTR — they're TOO good! Can afford to lower bids:

| Keyword | Current Bid | → New Bid | Reason |
|---------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| "luxury christmas wreath" | $5.00 | **$4.50** | 31% CTR = plenty headroom |
| "luxury christmas decor" | $5.00 | **$4.50** | 27% CTR = still dominant |
| "bespoke christmas decorations" | $3.25 | **$3.00** | 20% CTR = strong |

**Savings: ~$2-3/day from lower CPCs**

#### 3. ✅ PAUSE Non-Serving Luxury Keywords (Temporarily):

- "luxury christmas candle holder" ($4.75) - 0 imps
- All "Not eligible - rarely served" keywords with bids >$3

**Savings: $0 immediate (not spending), but cleans up account**

#### 4. ✅ Keep "luxury christmas wreaths" (plural) Active:
- Currently 0 imps at $4.50 bid

## Expected Results with $25/Day

### Current Reality (3 days):
- 334 imps, 37 clicks → **111 imps, 12 clicks/day**
- $108.86 / 3 = **$36.29/day**
- CTR: 11.08%
- Lost IS (budget): 89.78%

### After Optimization (Projected):
- **60-80 imps, 8-10 clicks/day** (lower volume, higher quality)
- **~$25/day spend** (controlled)
- **15-25% CTR** (only hero keywords serving)
- **$2.50-3.50 Avg CPC** (mix of keywords)
- **Lost IS (budget): 80-85%** (will stay high — budget is the constraint)

### Trade-offs:
- ✅ **Spend controlled** to $25/day
- ✅ **Higher average CTR** (only luxury terms)
- ✅ **Better quality clicks** (high-intent searchers)
- ⚠️ **Fewer total clicks** (8-10 vs 12/day)
- ⚠️ **Impression Share stays low** (<10%) — unavoidable with $25 budget

**Philosophy:** Quality over quantity. Better to have 8 clicks from "luxury christmas wreath" searchers (31% CTR) than 12 mixed clicks including generic "christmas wreath australia" (7% CTR).

## Critical Issues to Monitor

### 🚨 Issue #1: 0 Conversions After 37 Clicks
- **Not a targeting problem** — 27-31% CTR proves intent is perfect
- **Is a landing page/offer problem**
- **Action needed:**
  - Landing page audit: Does it match luxury ad messaging?
  - Price visibility: Are $150-300 prices shown? Or hidden?
  - Mobile UX: Is experience smooth on mobile?
  - Trust signals: Testimonials, guarantees, badges visible?
  - CTA clarity: Is "Add to Cart" prominent?

### 🚨 Issue #2: Lost IS (Budget) Increased
- Was 86% on Nov 1
- Now **89.78%** on Oct 31 - Nov 2
- **Reason:** Higher bids on hero keywords = hit budget cap faster
- **Reality:** With $25/day, losing 9x potential impressions
- **This is expected** — budget is the hard ceiling, not a fixable problem

### 🚨 Issue #3: "High End Christmas Wreath" Still Not Serving
- Re-enabled Nov 1 morning at $5.00 bid
- **0 impressions over 2 days**
- **Possible reasons:**
  - Quality Score too low?
  - Landing page mismatch?
  - Search volume truly zero?
- **Action:** Check quality score, landing page assignment, or pause

## Budget Reality Check

### Brutal Truth:
With $25/day budget in Christmas shopping season (Nov-Dec), you're competing against:
- Big box retailers (Kmart, Target, etc.) with $1000s/day budgets
- E-commerce giants (Amazon, eBay) with unlimited budgets
- Other small businesses willing to spend $50-100/day

**You cannot win on volume.** 

You CAN win on:
- ✅ Luxury positioning (hero keywords 27-31% CTR proves this)
- ✅ Niche targeting (avoiding generic terms)
- ✅ Quality over quantity (8-10 perfect clicks > 20 mixed clicks)
- ✅ Conversion rate optimization (once LP is fixed)

**Your hero keywords are performing exceptionally.** The strategy is correct. Budget is the constraint. Focus on converting the traffic you DO get.

---

## Strategy Validated ✅

**The Nov 1 luxury keyword strategy is working:**
- "luxury christmas wreath": **31.25% CTR** 🌟
- "luxury christmas decor": **27.59% CTR** 🌟
- "bespoke christmas decorations": **20.00% CTR**

**Industry benchmarks:**
- Average CTR for Search ads: 3-5%
- Good CTR: 8-10%
- Excellent CTR: 10-15%
- **Your hero keywords: 20-31%** = EXCEPTIONAL

**The problem is NOT the keywords or ads. The problem is:**
1. Budget constraint (can only afford 8-10 clicks/day at $25 budget)
2. Landing page not converting (0 ATC after 37 clicks)

**Next priority:** Fix the landing page. You're getting perfect traffic but not converting it.

---

**Status:** Analysis complete. Optimization plan ready to execute. Awaiting user action on keyword pauses and bid adjustments.
