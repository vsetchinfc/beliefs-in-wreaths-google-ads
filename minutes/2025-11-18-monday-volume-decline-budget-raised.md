- Lost IS (budget) still >90%, indicating both budget AND volume issues

## 🚨 Critical Issues & Status

### 1. Conversion Drought - 8 Consecutive Days

**Timeline:**
- Last conversion: Nov 11 ($285 sale)
- Days without conversion: Nov 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 (8 days)
- Clicks since last conversion: 3 (Nov 12) + 5 (Nov 13) + 3 (Nov 14) + 0 (Nov 15) + 3.5 avg (Nov 16-17) + 3 (Nov 18) = ~51 clicks
- Conversion rate over 8 days: 0 / 51 = 0%

**Previous Conversion Performance:**
- Nov 10-11: 2 conversions from 13 clicks (15.4% CVR)
- Nov 12-18: 0 conversions from 51 clicks (0% CVR)

**Possible Explanations:**
1. Small sample size (51 clicks insufficient for statistical significance at 1-2% CVR)
2. Product/price point mismatch (premium $150-$300 wreaths, long consideration time)
3. Seasonality (early November purchases vs mid-November consideration phase)
4. Landing page conversion barriers (need optimization)
5. Audience quality changed (different search intent in weeks 2-3 vs week 1)

**User Confirmation:**
- No abandoned checkouts today
- No purchases today
- GA4 key event (1) was likely add_to_cart or other engagement, not purchase

### 2. Volume Decline - Monday Effect

**Nov 18 Volume (Monday):**
- 22 impressions (lowest day since single-keyword strategy)
- 3 clicks
- $22.39 spend (74.6% budget utilization)

**Expected Pattern:**
- Mondays typically have 10-20% lower search volume than weekends
- Today's 14% decline aligns with typical Monday pattern

**Concern:**
- Budget utilization dropped to 74.6% (from 91.8%)
- Suggests auction volume constraints, not just budget limits
- Even with full $30 budget available, campaign couldn't spend it all

**Action Taken:**
- User raised budget from $30/day to $40/day
- Purpose: Test if higher budget increases impression volume
- Expected outcome: If volume-constrained, higher budget won't change impressions. If budget-constrained, impressions should increase 20-30%.

### 3. Campaign ROI Declining

**Financial Summary Through Nov 18:**

| Period | Spend | Revenue | ROI | Source |
|--------|-------|---------|-----|--------|
| Nov 10-11 (First 2 sales) | ~$166 | $470 | +183% | Historical minutes |
| Nov 10-17 (8 days) | $414.60 | $470 | +13% | Weekend minutes |
| Nov 10-18 (9 days) | $437.00 | $470 | +7.6% | Campaign reports |

**ROI Trend:** +183% → +13% → +7.6% (declining)

**Projection (27 days remaining):**
- If no new sales: ($470 - $437 - $27×40) / ($437 + $27×40) = -54% ROI (loss)
- If 1 sale ($200): ($470 + $200 - $437 - $27×40) / ($437 + $27×40) = -40% ROI (loss)
- Need 6+ sales to break even: ($470 + $200×6 - $437 - $27×40) / ($437 + $27×40) = +1% ROI

**With $40/day budget:**
- 27 days remaining: $40 × 27 = $1,080 additional spend
- Total campaign spend: $437 + $1,080 = $1,517
- Break-even: Need $1,517 revenue = 5.5 more sales at $275 avg
- **Realistic:** 4-6 sales possible (1 sale per 5-7 days at current 0.9% CVR baseline)

### 4. Single Point of Failure Risk

**Current State:**
- 1 active keyword: "stylish christmas wreaths"
- 0 backup keywords serving
- 100% traffic dependency on single keyword

**Risk:**
- If Quality Score degrades → impressions drop to 0
- If competitors outbid → impressions drop
- If search demand shifts → campaign dies

**Mitigation Attempted:**
- Weekend test of 5 new keywords: All failed (0 impressions)
- Bid increases up to $12: Failed to activate "luxury christmas wreaths"
- Conclusion: Can't diversify keyword base with current account/campaign Quality Score

**Alternative Traffic Sources:**
- Google Shopping: User has on todo list (will set up)
- SEO: Already generating 6-12 organic sessions/weekend
- Direct: Already generating 3-4 sessions/day
- Social: Not active

---

---

## ❌ What's Not Working

1. **Conversion Rate Collapsed:**
   - 0 conversions from 51 clicks since Nov 11 (0% CVR)
   - Previous baseline: 15.4% CVR (2 sales from 13 clicks Nov 10-11)
   - Likely reversion to mean: 0.14% historical CVR (Aug-Oct: 2 sales / 1,382 clicks)

2. **Insufficient Volume:**
   - 22 impressions/day = 3 clicks/day
   - At 1% CVR: Need 100 clicks for 1 sale = 33 days
   - 27 days remaining = max ~81 clicks = 0.8 sales expected
   - **Volume insufficient to hit targets**

3. **Cannot Diversify Keywords:**
   - All attempts to activate second keyword failed
   - Fresh keywords get 0 impressions
   - Bid increases don't overcome Quality Score/volume issues
   - Stuck with single-keyword strategy

4. **Monday Volume Cliff:**
   - 22 impressions (lowest day recorded)
   - 74.6% budget utilization (hitting volume constraints)
   - Lost IS >90% unchanged (both budget AND volume limited)

---

## 🎯 Strategic Decisions & Actions Taken

### Decision 1: Budget Increase $30 → $40/day

**User Decision:** Budget raised from $30/day to $40/day

**Rationale:**
- Monday volume dropped to 22 impressions (lowest recorded)
- Budget utilization only 74.6% (campaign couldn't spend full budget)
- Lost IS (budget) still >90%
- Test: Will higher budget capture more volume?

**Expected Outcomes:**

**Scenario A: Budget-Constrained (Best Case)**
- Impressions increase to 28-30/day (+25-35%)
- Clicks increase to 4-5/day (+33%)
- Spend increases to $35-40/day (87.5-100% utilization)
- Lost IS (budget) decreases to 80-85%
- **Actionable:** Confirms budget was limiting factor

**Scenario B: Volume-Constrained (Likely Case)**
- Impressions stay 22-25/day (no change)
- Clicks stay 3-4/day (no change)
- Spend stays $22-28/day (55-70% utilization)
- Lost IS (budget) stays >90%
- **Actionable:** Confirms auction volume is limiting factor, need alternative traffic sources

**Monitoring Plan:**
- Check tomorrow (Nov 19) if impressions increased
- 3-day test (Nov 19-21) to account for daily variation
- If no volume increase by Nov 21 → confirm volume-constrained, implement Plan B

**Financial Impact:**
- Additional spend: $10/day × 27 days = $270
- Total campaign spend: $437 + $270 = $707 (vs $1,150 total budget available)
- Break-even: Need 1 more sale (~$200) to maintain +7% ROI

### Decision 2: No New Negative Keywords

**Analysis:** All 7 search terms today are legitimate
- User confirmed they sell white wreaths ✅
- User confirmed they sell pink wreaths ✅
- "christmas wreath", "christmas wreaths", "xmas door wreath" all relevant ✅

**Action:** No negative keywords added (899 total maintained)

### Decision 3: Google Shopping Setup Remains on User's Todo

**User Status:** "Yes, will need to, on my todo list"

**Recommendation:** Prioritize Shopping setup this week
- Expected volume: +30-50 impressions/day
- Bypasses Search Quality Score issues
- Visual products (wreaths) perform well in Shopping
- Can run parallel to Search campaign

**Setup Time:** 30-60 minutes (guide already created: `docs/guides/setup-google-shopping-campaign.md`)

---

## 🎯 Recommendations & Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Nov 19)

1. **Monitor Budget Increase Impact:**
   - Check if impressions increased from 22 → 28-30 with $40 budget
   - Compare tomorrow's volume to Monday baseline (22 imps)
   - Note: Tuesday typically higher volume than Monday anyway

2. **Watch for Conversions:**
   - 8th day without sale - critical
   - GA4 showed 1 key event (add_to_cart?) - may convert in 24-48 hours
   - If no sale by Nov 20 → 10 days without conversion (crisis level)

3. **Review Search Terms Daily:**
   - Continue monitoring for new negative keyword opportunities
   - All terms today were legitimate (white/pink wreaths)
   - 0% waste maintained

### This Week (Nov 19-22)

1. **Google Shopping Campaign Setup (PRIORITY):**
   - User confirmed on todo list
   - Expected: +30-50 impressions/day from visual searches
   - Setup guide: `docs/guides/setup-google-shopping-campaign.md`
   - Budget: $10/day recommended (total $40 Search + $10 Shopping = $50/day)
   - Timeline: 30-60 minutes setup

2. **Budget Test Analysis (3 days):**
   - Day 1 (Nov 19): Initial signal
   - Day 2 (Nov 20): Confirm trend
   - Day 3 (Nov 21): Decision point
   - If volume unchanged → volume-constrained, Shopping becomes critical

3. **Conversion Rate Analysis:**
   - Current: 0% over 51 clicks (8 days)
   - Historical baseline: 0.14% (Aug-Oct)
   - Recent spike: 15.4% (Nov 10-11)
   - Need to determine: Is 15% an outlier or 0% an outlier?
   - More data needed (minimum 100 clicks for statistical significance)

### Strategic Options (If Budget Test Fails)

**If impressions don't increase with $40 budget:**

**Option A: Accept Volume Reality**
- Maintain $30/day budget (save $10/day = $270 over 27 days)
- Expected: 4-6 sales maximum
- ROI: Borderline profitable (+5-15%)
- Risk: Low ceiling on results

**Option B: Aggressive Diversification**
- Google Shopping: +30-50 imps/day
- SEO optimization: Double organic traffic (currently 6-12 sessions/weekend)
- Email marketing: Abandoned cart sequences for add_to_cart visitors
- Social media: Instagram/Pinterest for visual luxury products
- Risk: More work, uncertain ROI

**Option C: Landing Page Optimization Priority**
- Current CVR: 0% (51 clicks, 0 sales)
- Need: Convert existing traffic better
- Focus: Trust signals, urgency, social proof, Australian Made prominence
- Expected: 0.14% → 1-2% CVR (7-14x improvement)
- Risk: Requires A/B testing, uncertain impact

## 📈 Projections for Remaining 27 Days

### Conservative Scenario (Current Trend Continues)
- Daily: 22-25 impressions, 3-4 clicks, $25-28 spend
- 27 days: 594-675 impressions, 81-108 clicks, $675-756 spend
- Conversions: 0-1 at 0.14% historical CVR (81 clicks × 0.14% = 0.1 sales)
- Revenue: $0-200
- Total campaign: $437 + $675-756 = $1,112-1,193 spend, $470-670 revenue
- **Final ROI: -40% to -44% (LOSS)**

### Realistic Scenario (Budget Increase Captures More Volume)
- Daily: 28-32 impressions, 4-5 clicks, $32-38 spend
- 27 days: 756-864 impressions, 108-135 clicks, $864-1,026 spend
- Conversions: 1-2 at 1% CVR (108-135 clicks × 1% = 1-1.4 sales)
- Revenue: $200-400
- Total campaign: $437 + $864-1,026 = $1,301-1,463 spend, $670-870 revenue
- **Final ROI: -38% to -49% (LOSS)**

### Optimistic Scenario (Budget + Shopping + CVR Improvement)
- Search daily: 28-32 impressions, 4-5 clicks, $32-38 spend
- Shopping daily: 40 impressions, 2 clicks, $8-10 spend (estimated)
- Combined daily: 68-72 impressions, 6-7 clicks, $40-48 spend
- 27 days: 162-189 clicks
- Conversions: 3-4 at 2% CVR (162-189 clicks × 2% = 3.2-3.8 sales)
- Revenue: $600-800
- Total campaign: $437 + $1,080-1,296 = $1,517-1,733 spend, $1,070-1,270 revenue
- **Final ROI: -26% to -29% (LOSS)** or break-even with 5+ sales

### Best Case Scenario (All Optimizations Work)
- Daily: 80-100 combined impressions (Search + Shopping + SEO), 8-10 clicks
- CVR improves to 2-3% (landing page optimization + trust signals)
- 27 days: 216-270 clicks
- Conversions: 5-8 sales at 2.5% CVR (216-270 clicks × 2.5% = 5.4-6.8 sales)
- Revenue: $1,000-1,600
- Total campaign spend: ~$1,600-1,800
- **Final ROI: -20% to -38% (LOSS)** or break-even

**Reality Check:**
All scenarios show campaign likely to end in loss or break-even. Original target of 10-12 sales ($2,000-2,400 revenue) appears unrealistic with current volume constraints and 0% CVR over 8 days.

**Viable Goal:** 4-6 sales, break-even or small profit, establish baseline for 2026 holiday season planning.

## 🎯 Questions for Next Session

1. **Did impressions increase on Nov 19 with $40 budget?** (Test if budget-constrained vs volume-constrained)

2. **Any conversions Nov 19-20?** (Break 8-day drought? GA4 key event convert?)

3. **Ready to set up Google Shopping this week?** (30-60 min, could add 30-50 imps/day)

4. **Want to test landing page optimizations?** (Focus on conversion rate vs volume)

5. **Comfortable with break-even goal vs 10-12 sales original target?** (Reset expectations based on volume reality)

**End of Monday Nov 18, 2025 Analysis**

**Key Takeaway:** Volume declined to 22 impressions (lowest day), budget raised to $40/day to test constraints. Conversion drought continues (8 days). Single keyword strategy stable but insufficient volume for original sales targets. Google Shopping setup becomes critical priority.
