## 🎯 Project Overview

**⚠️ URGENT: CHRISTMAS SALES WINDOW CLOSING**

This project contains an emergency optimization plan to maximize Beliefs in Wreaths' Christmas wreath sales. With only 11 weeks until Christmas (and 10 weeks until last order dates), immediate action is critical.

### Current Situation - CHRISTMAS FOCUS
- **Time remaining:** 11 weeks until Christmas (Oct 4 - Dec 25)
- **Daily impressions:** ~2.5 (essentially invisible to Christmas shoppers)
- **Active keywords:** 59 Christmas keywords (but 91.5% getting 0 impressions)
- **CTR:** 13.89% ✅ (excellent when ads show)
- **Current spend:** ~$5-10/day ❌ (far too low for Christmas season)
- **Strategy:** 100% focus on Christmas Products (All Year Products will stay paused per client decision)

### Critical Timeline
- **Early October (NOW):** Best ROI - early shoppers, less competition
- **November:** Peak volume - highest traffic
- **Early December:** Last-minute rush
- **Dec 15:** Last order date for Christmas delivery

### Key Finding
**The campaign has excellent fundamentals (13.89% CTR) but needs immediate 5-10x budget increase to capture Christmas sales before the window closes.**

## 💰 Christmas Budget Recommendations

### Current Budget
Estimated: $5-10/day (~$150-300/month) ❌ **TOO LOW FOR CHRISTMAS**

### Recommended Christmas Budget (Oct-Dec Only)
**$40-50/day October-November ($1,200-1,500/month)**  
**$60-80/day December 1-15 for final push**

- Christmas is 70% of annual wreath sales for most retailers

- Limited 11-week window - need to capture market share NOW
- Early October = best ROI (less competition, lower CPCs)

### Expected Christmas ROI
**Conservative:**
- Total spend: $3,600-4,700
- Expected revenue: $9,000-12,000
- **ROAS: 250%**

**Optimistic:**
- Total spend: $3,600-4,700
