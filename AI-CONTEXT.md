## What to do first when resuming
1. Check Nov 2 morning reports to see overnight performance after Nov 1 bid increases.
2. Verify "high end christmas wreath" (re-enabled Nov 1) is getting impressions.
3. Check if centrepiece keywords (luxury christmas centrepieces, candle holder) are serving with new $4.75 bids.
4. Review Search Terms for any waste; add negatives immediately (50+ already added Nov 1).
5. If hero keywords still <20% Impression Share: consider +$0.25 bid boost or accept budget constraint reality.
6. Monitor GA4 for first add_to_cart signal from Paid Search (0 so far after 70+ clicks total).

## Tracking and quality gates
- GA4→Google Ads linking completed on 2025-10-29; conversions importing correctly.
- GA4 Paid Search (Oct 29-31): 47 sessions, 70.2% engagement rate, 33.5s avg time, 0 key events (purchases).
- **Alert**: 0 add_to_cart events from Paid Search after 70+ clicks total — needs monitoring. If 0 ATC after 100+ clicks = LP/value issue, not keyword issue.
- Current metrics (Nov 1): CTR 10.46% ✅ (target 8-12%), Avg CPC $2.71 ⚠️ (rising with luxury focus, expected), Lost IS budget 85% 🔴 (main blocker).
- Week 1 targets: 1-3 conversions, 8-11% CTR ✅, $3-4 CPC ⚠️ (on track), IS 20-40% 🔴 (still <10%).

## Known pitfalls and lessons learned
- **Budget throttling is the #1 issue**: 85% Lost IS (budget) means losing 6x potential impressions. Raising bids helps win more auctions within constrained budget but won't magically 10x traffic.
- **Luxury longtail = low volume**: Many hero keywords show "Not eligible — rarely served" status. This is normal for ultra-specific terms like "luxury handcrafted christmas wreath". They'll trigger for close variants.
- **30% CTR is exceptional**: "Luxury christmas wreath" and "luxury christmas decor" both at ~30% CTR confirms audience quality is perfect. Low click volume is acceptable.
- **Centrepieces opportunity**: Centrepieces RSA consistently outperforms wreaths (10-11% CTR vs 8-9%, lower CPC). Less competitive niche.
- **Generic broad wastes budget fast**: "christmas table decorations" burned $46 for 23 clicks with 0 conversions before being paused. Keep generic discovery off.
- **CSV imports**: Require exact headers plus Campaign ID and Ad group columns; Phrase match needs triple quotes (e.g., """luxury christmas wreath""").
- **Always verify**: Campaign ID 20291611349 and Ad group "Christmas Products" to avoid keyword misplacement.

## If context is missing in a new session
- Read: `ACTION-PLAN.md` (updated Nov 1 with current strategy) and latest minutes file under `minutes/`.
- Check `data/keyword-reports/` for most recent performance reports (sorted by date in filename).
- Review this file (`AI-CONTEXT.md`) for latest status and completed actions.
- Key question for user: "What date's reports do you have?" then analyze against previous baseline.

## Next session priorities (Nov 2+)
1. Review Nov 1 full-day reports — did hero keywords sustain 30% CTR? Did "high end christmas wreath" serve?
2. Check if centrepiece keywords got impressions with $4.75 bids.
3. If IS still <15-20% on hero terms after 24 hours: consider +$0.25 bid boost OR accept budget reality.
4. Monitor Search Terms 2-3x daily first week; add negatives immediately.
5. Watch GA4 for first add_to_cart signal; if 0 after 100+ clicks: flag LP review.
6. Weekend (Nov 2-3): lighter monitoring; full Week 1 review Monday Nov 4.
