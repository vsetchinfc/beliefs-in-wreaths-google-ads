# Rapid context for future sessions — Beliefs in Wreaths (Google Ads)

Last updated: 2025-11-15
Owner: vsetchinfc
Scope: Christmas Search campaign (AU) — 30 days remaining (Nov 15–Dec 15, 2025)

## TL;DR
- Running **$30/day** budget. **SINGLE KEYWORD STRATEGY CONFIRMED**: Only "stylish christmas wreaths" ($7.00) serving. All other keywords paused.
- **🚨 WEEKEND TEST FAILED (Nov 16-17)**: Added 5 new keywords Friday - all got 0 impressions over entire weekend. Paused Nov 17.
- **🚨 GOOGLE AUTO-APPLY CRISIS (Nov 15)**: Google re-enabled 10+ auto-apply bidding settings without notification. All disabled, monthly check reminder added.
- Active keywords: **1 ONLY** ("stylish christmas wreaths"). All alternatives failed (luxury, bespoke, handmade, designer, premium).
- Negative keywords: 899 total (added 7 more Nov 17), achieving **0% waste** (perfect traffic quality).
- Volume: 25-28 impressions/day with single keyword. <10% impression share (losing 90%+ of auctions).
- **Campaign status:** 2 sales ($470 revenue), $414.60 spend, +13% ROI. **7 days without conversion** (Nov 12-17) 🔴.
- **28 days remaining:** Need 1 sale every 4-5 days to hit targets. Currently BEHIND pace.

## Important: Google Ads UI Version
**Using NEW Google Ads UI (2024-2025 interface)**
- Reports path: Campaigns → Insights and reports → Predefined reports
- Demographics: Campaigns → Audiences, keywords and content → Demographics
- Search terms: Campaigns → Insights and reports → Search terms
- Locations: Campaigns → Locations (left sidebar)
- For future sessions: Use updated navigation paths for new UI

## 🚨 MONTHLY REMINDER: Check Auto-Apply Settings
**⏰ CHECK ON THE 1ST OF EACH MONTH**

Google periodically re-enables auto-apply recommendations without warning. These can automatically change your bidding strategy from Manual CPC to automated bidding.

**How to check:**
1. Go to **Recommendations** (left sidebar)
2. Look for **gear icon ⚙️** or **"Auto-apply"** button (top-right of page)
3. Click to open auto-apply settings

**CRITICAL - Keep these DISABLED:**
- ❌ All 10+ options under **"Bidding"** section:
  - Bid more efficiently with Target impression share
  - Bid more efficiently with Maximise clicks
  - Bid more efficiently with Maximise conversions
  - Bid more efficiently with Maximise conversion value
  - Set a target CPA/ROAS
  - Adjust CPA/ROAS targets
  - etc.
- ❌ Add broad match keywords (under Keywords & targeting)
- ❌ Add store visits as account default goal (you're online-only)

**Safe to keep ENABLED:**
- ✅ Remove redundant keywords
- ✅ Remove non-serving keywords  
- ✅ Remove conflicting negative keywords

**Why this matters:** With only 2-3 conversions, automated bidding will waste your budget. Manual CPC gives you control with limited data.

**Last checked:** November 15, 2025 - All bidding auto-apply settings were enabled and have been disabled.

## Important: Product Details
**What Beliefs in Wreaths Sells:**
✅ **Artificial flowers and greenery** (faux, high-quality, luxury positioning)  
✅ Christmas wreaths made from artificial materials  
✅ Faux decorations and centrepieces  
✅ Premium artificial greenery (NOT dried, NOT fresh, NOT real)

**Critical for keywords/negatives:**
- "Fake" = positive search term (people looking for artificial!)
- "Artificial" = core product category (not negative!)
- "Faux" = premium synonym for artificial (luxury positioning!)
- "Dried" = WRONG product (correctly blocked as negative) ✅
- "Fresh" = WRONG product (correctly blocked as negative) ✅

## Landing Page & Site Status (Verified Nov 15, 2025)

**✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED (Working Well):**
- Afterpay messaging on product pages ("Pay with 4 interest-free payments")
- Christmas urgency in announcement bar ("ORDER BY DEC 15 FOR CHRISTMAS")
- Free shipping messaging prominent ("FREE DELIVERY OVER $140")
- Free shipping confirmation in cart ("You've earned FREE SHIPPING!")
- Payment provider logos visible (Afterpay, PayPal in header)
- Multiple checkout options (Shop Pay, PayPal, Google Pay)
- Testimonial bar with rotating 5-star reviews
- Premium positioning ("Bespoke Designer", "Premium Artificial", "Limited Edition")
- Value propositions ("No wilting, no maintenance", "Enjoy for years to come")
- Scarcity messaging ("1-2 pieces only", "Once sold, gone forever")
- Australian studio messaging in descriptions

**🟡 COULD BE ENHANCED (Minor Gaps):**
- Live stock level indicators not shown (messaging exists but no "Only 2 left!" badges)
- "Australian Made" could be more prominent (in announcement bar rotation)
- Customer photos/Instagram feed not visible on landing pages
- Trust badges (ships 24hrs, returns, guarantee) not above Add to Cart button

**❌ NOT APPLICABLE (Business Model Reasons):**
- Product star ratings per item: NOT SUITABLE - products are limited edition (1-3 pieces only), not mass-produced. Testimonials work better for bespoke/exclusive positioning.
- Price value calculator ("$240 ÷ 10 years = $24/Christmas"): Previously tested, business manager rejected - doesn't align with luxury/exclusive brand positioning.

**📊 Conversion Rate Reality:**
- Current CR: ~1.67% (2 sales from ~120 clicks Nov 10-15)
- **This is NORMAL for $180-240 premium products**
- Industry standard for luxury/premium: 1-2% is typical
- Site quality is NOT the blocker - traffic volume is the issue

**🎯 Real Issue: Traffic Volume, Not Site Quality**
- Site converts at expected rate for price point
- Problem: Only 3-6 visitors/day from Google Ads (18 impressions)
- Need 100-150 visitors/day to generate consistent sales at 1-2% CR
- Focus should be on traffic generation, not site optimization

## Project identifiers
- Site: https://beliefsinwreaths.com.au/
- Primary landing: https://beliefsinwreaths.com.au/collections/christmas-wreaths
- Platform: Shopify; Analytics: GA4 linked to Google Ads
- Google Ads campaign: "B-in-W [Search | Sales]" (ID: 20291611349)
- Ad group: "Christmas Products"

## Strategy snapshot
**Historical (Aug 1–Oct 30):**
- 3-month reality: 1,382 clicks, 2 conversions, 0.14% CVR, $508 CPA — failing overall.
- Breakthrough: "luxury christmas wreath" (Phrase) — 6 clicks, 2 conv (33.33% CVR), $6.14 CPA.

**Current (Nov 10-17, 2025 / 8 days):**
- **BREAKTHROUGH then DECLINE:**
  - Nov 10-11: 2 SALES ACHIEVED! ($185 + $285 = $470 revenue)
  - "stylish christmas wreaths" (Phrase, $7.00): Only converting keyword
  - Nov 12: Reduced budget to $30/day, achieved 0% waste, single keyword only
  - Nov 13-17: **7 consecutive days without conversion** 🔴
- **Weekend test failed (Nov 15-17):**
  - Added 5 new keywords Friday (premium, designer, handmade, artificial, bespoke)
  - ALL 5 got 0 impressions over entire weekend
  - Status: "Not eligible" or "Eligible but not serving"
  - All paused Nov 17
- **Single keyword strategy confirmed:**
  - Only "stylish christmas wreaths" ($7.00) serving
  - Weekend: 51 impressions, 7 clicks, $55.07 spend (Nov 16-17)
  - Average: 25-28 impressions/day, 3-4 clicks/day, $27.54/day spend
  - Budget utilization: 91.8% (optimal)
- Overall metrics (Nov 10-17, 8 days): 2 sales, $414.60 spend, $470 revenue, **+13% ROI**
- Lost IS (budget): **>90%** (unchanged - single keyword limitation)
- **Traffic quality:** 0% waste (899 negative keywords after Nov 17 additions)
- **Campaign status:** Profitable but behind pace, volume-limited, single point of failure
## What to do first when resuming
1. **🚨 CHECK DATE**: If it's the 1st of any month, verify Google auto-apply settings (see section above for details)
2. **Save all reports locally**: Export and save reports to `data/keyword-reports/` with format `2025-MM-DD-report-name.csv`:
   - Campaign report
   - Search keyword report
   - Search terms report
   - Device report
   - Landing page report
   - Ad report
   - GA4 traffic acquisition report
3. **Create minutes file**: After analysis, create comprehensive minutes file in `minutes/` folder with format `2025-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md`:
   - Include: Performance summary, key metrics vs previous day, what worked/failed, actions taken, insights, next steps
   - Document all critical decisions and discoveries
   - Update AI-CONTEXT.md if strategy changes
4. **Review weekend performance** (if applicable): Did Saturday-Sunday show higher volume for luxury buyers?
5. **Check conversion status**: Any sales since Nov 11? (Currently 4 days without conversion - critical)
6. **Verify single keyword status**: Is "stylish christmas wreaths" still serving? Performance stable?
7. **"Luxury" keyword check**: Did "luxury christmas wreaths" ever start serving at $12 bid? (Failed Nov 14-15)
8. **Traffic quality**: Is 0% waste maintained? (Has been perfect since Nov 14)
9. **Budget utilization**: Is campaign spending closer to $30/day target? (Nov 15 only spent $19.96)
10. **Strategic decision**: Accept single-keyword reality OR invest time in separate luxury ad group?
## Completed actions

### ✅ Nov 10-11, 2025: BREAKTHROUGH - First Sales Achieved
**2 Conversions Generated:**
- Nov 10: $185 sale from "stylish christmas wreaths" 
- Nov 11: $285 sale from "luxury christmas decor" (click on Nov 9)
- Total revenue: $470
- Spend: ~$166 (at $84/day budget)
- Campaign now profitable: +183% ROI

**Key Learning:** "Stylish christmas wreaths" identified as hero keyword with 7.69% conversion rate.

### ✅ Nov 12, 2025: Budget Reduction & Efficiency Focus
**Actions Taken:**
- Reduced budget from $84/day to $30/day (sustainable level)
- Paused non-performing keywords
- Kept only 2 active: "stylish christmas wreaths" ($7.00), "luxury christmas decor" ($4.50)
- Device bid adjustments: Mobile +20%, Desktop/Tablet -70%
- Added 50+ negative keywords (competitors, wrong products, wrong styles)

**Results:**
- Achieved 0% waste (perfect traffic quality)
- $34.19 spend, 16 impressions, 5 clicks, 31.25% CTR
- 0 conversions (expected with 2-3 day attribution lag)

### ✅ Nov 13, 2025: Waste Cleanup
**Problem:** Waste returned (45% of impressions from competitors/wrong products)

**Actions Taken:**
- Added 11 negative keywords: tk maxx, zara, laura ashley, tablecloth, kitsch, perth, big, large
- Raised "luxury christmas decor" bid: $4.50 → $6.00 (trying to activate after 3 days 0 impressions)

**Results:**
- Volume increased (44 impressions)
- Waste decreased but still present
- "Luxury christmas decor" still got 0 impressions despite bid increase

### ✅ Nov 14, 2025: Keyword Swap Strategy
**Problem:** "Luxury christmas decor" failed for 4 days straight (0 impressions)
**Root Cause:** Ad/keyword mismatch (keyword says "decor" but all ads say "wreaths")

**Actions Taken:**
- Paused: "luxury christmas decor"
- Enabled: "luxury christmas wreaths" (plural) at $7.50 bid
- Rationale: Perfect match with wreath-focused ad copy
- Added 4 negative keywords: burlap, nativity, "34th and pine"

**Results:**
- Volume collapsed to 13 impressions (worst day)
- Keyword swap failed - "luxury christmas wreaths" got 0 impressions

### ✅ Nov 15, 2025: Auto-Apply Crisis & Weekend Test Setup
**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Google re-enabled 10+ auto-apply bidding recommendation settings without notification!

**Actions Taken:**
- Disabled all 10+ bidding auto-apply settings
- Disabled "Add store visits as account default goal"
- Added monthly reminder to AI-CONTEXT.md (check on 1st of each month)
- Raised "luxury christmas wreaths" bid: $7.50 → $12.00 (testing if Quality Score can be overcome)
- Added 5 NEW keywords for weekend test:
  1. "premium christmas wreaths australia" ($5.50)
  2. "designer door wreaths christmas" ($5.00)
  3. "handmade christmas door wreaths" ($5.00)
  4. "artificial christmas wreaths luxury" ($5.50)
  5. "bespoke christmas wreaths" ($6.00)

**Results:**
- Volume: 18 impressions
- "Luxury christmas wreaths" STILL got 0 impressions at $12 bid
- 0% waste maintained
- 4th consecutive day without conversion

### ✅ Nov 16-17, 2025: Weekend Test - All New Keywords Failed
**WEEKEND TEST RESULTS:** All 5 new keywords got 0 impressions over entire weekend.

**Performance by keyword:**
- "premium christmas wreaths australia" → Status: Paused (rarely served), 0 impressions
- "designer door wreaths christmas" → Status: Not eligible, 0 impressions
- "handmade christmas door wreaths" → Status: Eligible, 0 impressions
- "artificial christmas wreaths luxury" → Status: Not eligible (rarely served), 0 impressions
- "bespoke christmas wreaths" → Status: Eligible, 0 impressions

**Only keyword serving:**
- "stylish christmas wreaths" → 51 impressions, 7 clicks, $55.07 spend (100% of traffic)

**Actions Taken:**
- Paused all 5 new keywords (Nov 17)
- Paused "luxury christmas wreaths" (0 imps for 6 days despite $12 bid)
- Paused "handmade christmas door wreaths" (0 imps)
- Added 7 negative keywords: "marks spencer", "marks and spencer", "m&s", "rattan", "extra large", "1 metre", "real"
- Total negative keywords: 899

**Results:**
- Weekend: 51 imps, 7 clicks, 13.73% CTR, $55.07 ($27.54/day)
- Budget utilization: 91.8% ($27.54/$30)
- Conversions: 0 (7th consecutive day without sale)
- Campaign spend to date: $414.60, Revenue: $470, ROI: +13%

**Key Learning:** Fresh keywords don't solve Quality Score issues. Low search volume or account-level Quality Score penalties prevent serving regardless of bid amount or keyword freshness. Single-keyword strategy is reality, not choice.

### ✅ Nov 1, 2025: Initial luxury optimization (HISTORICAL - Pre-Budget Reduction)
**Paused keywords:**
- christmas table decorations (Broad) — was 235 imps, 23 clicks, $46 (wrong intent)
- christmas wreath (Broad) — was 74 imps, 8 clicks, $9.65
- [buy christmas wreath] (Exact)
- "christmas wreaths australia" (Phrase)
- "designer christmas wreaths" (Phrase)
- "christmas door wreaths" (Phrase)
- Other low/no volume terms

**Re-enabled winner:**
- "high end christmas wreath" (Phrase) — was mistakenly paused; had 20% CTR, $3.95 CPC before pause.
- Re-enabled Nov 1 morning with $5.00 bid. **Status Nov 2**: Still 0 impressions after 2 days → likely quality score issue or zero search volume.

**Bid increases (Nov 1 morning):**
- "luxury christmas wreath" (Phrase): $5.00 → **$5.50** ✅ performing (30.77% CTR)
- "luxury christmas wreaths" (Phrase): $3.50 → **$4.50** ✅ (0 imps yet)
- "luxury christmas decor" (Phrase): $4.50 → **$5.00** ✅ star performer (29.41% CTR)
- "handmade christmas wreaths" (Phrase): $2.50 → **$3.50** ✅ (7 imps, 0 clicks)
- "luxury christmas centrepieces" (Phrase): $4.50 → **$4.75** ✅ (0 imps yet)
- "luxury christmas candle holder" (Phrase): $4.25 → **$4.75** ✅ (0 imps yet)

### ✅ Nov 3, 2025: Negative keywords crisis discovery & resolution
**Critical discovery:** Campaign has 1,119 negative keywords, but **14 terms blocking artificial/faux product searches**—which is exactly what the business sells!

**Product clarity revealed:**
- Beliefs in Wreaths sells: **Artificial flowers and greenery** (NOT dried, NOT fresh)
- "Fake" = positive search term (people looking for artificial!)
- "Artificial" = core product category (not negative quality signal!)
- "Faux" = premium synonym for artificial (luxury positioning!)

**Negative keywords blocking own product (REMOVE THESE 14):**
1. `fake` (Broad) 🚨 CRITICAL — blocks "fake christmas wreaths" = YOUR CUSTOMERS!
2. `artificial flowers spotlight` (Exact)
3. `[artificial christmas tree australia]` (Exact)
4. `[cheap artificial flowers australia]` (Exact)
5. `[artificial xmas plants]` (Exact) 🚨 YOUR PRODUCT CATEGORY!
6. `[artificial flowers wholesale bulk]` (Exact)
7. `[artificial flowers wholesale liverpool]` (Exact)
8. `[artificial crocus]` (Exact)
9. `[faux indoor hanging plants]` (Exact) 🚨 FAUX = YOUR PRODUCT!
10. `[artifical fliwers]` (Exact) — misspelling
11. `[fake purple flowers]` (Exact)
12. `[artificial spruce christmas tree]` (Exact)
13. `[uv protected artificial outdoor plants]` (Exact)
14. `[ebay artificial flower arrangements]` (Exact)

**Correctly blocking (KEEP THESE):**
- ✅ All "dried" negatives (dried flower wreaths, dried wreaths, etc.) — correct, doesn't sell dried
- ✅ All "fresh" negatives (fresh wreaths, fresh flowers, etc.) — correct, doesn't sell fresh
- ✅ Competitors, DIY, lights, price modifiers — all correct

**Files created:**
- `data/keyword-reports/NEGATIVE-KEYWORDS-TO-REMOVE.csv` — 14 terms to remove + instructions
- `minutes/2025-11-03-negative-keywords-crisis.md` — Full crisis analysis (6,000+ words)

**Expected impact after removal:**
- +20-30% impression volume (access to artificial/fake/faux searches)
- +2-3 clicks/day (high-intent artificial product searchers)
- CTR maintained or improved to 12-15%
- Spend may increase to $35-38/day initially, then stabilize $25-30
- Better product-market fit (artificial searchers = exactly what you sell!)

**Why this matters:**
- No "artificial" terms in Search Terms report = they were BLOCKED!
- Missing 20-30% of addressable market (artificial product category)
- Lost IS >90% partly due to blocked category searches (not just budget!)
- Landing page needs "Premium Artificial" messaging (explains 0 ATC after 44 clicks)

## Tracking and quality gates
- GA4→Google Ads linking completed on 2025-10-29; conversions importing correctly.
- GA4 Paid Search (Oct 31 - Nov 2): 25 sessions, 64% engagement rate, 32.56s avg time, 0 key events (purchases).
- **CRITICAL ALERT**: **0 add_to_cart events** after 37 clicks / 25 sessions 🔴
  - This is NOT a targeting problem (31% CTR on hero keywords = perfect intent)
  - This IS a landing page/offer/value prop problem
  - **Action required**: Landing page audit and implement luxury homepage mockup
- Current metrics (Nov 2, 3 days): CTR **11.08%** ✅ (excellent), Avg CPC $2.94 (expected with luxury focus), Lost IS budget **89.78%** 🔴 (worse - higher bids hit cap faster).
- After Nov 2 optimization: Expect CTR 15-25% (only luxury keywords), 8-10 clicks/day, ~$25 daily spend, Lost IS budget will stay 80-85%.

## Tracking and quality gates
- GA4→Google Ads linking completed on 2025-10-29; conversions importing correctly.
- GA4 Paid Search (Oct 29-31): 47 sessions, 70.2% engagement rate, 33.5s avg time, 0 key events (purchases).
- **Alert**: 0 add_to_cart events from Paid Search after 70+ clicks total — needs monitoring. If 0 ATC after 100+ clicks = LP/value issue, not keyword issue.
- Current metrics (Nov 1): CTR 10.46% ✅ (target 8-12%), Avg CPC $2.71 ⚠️ (rising with luxury focus, expected), Lost IS budget 85% 🔴 (main blocker).
- Week 1 targets: 1-3 conversions, 8-11% CTR ✅, $3-4 CPC ⚠️ (on track), IS 20-40% 🔴 (still <10%).

## Known pitfalls and lessons learned
- **Budget throttling is the #1 issue**: 85% Lost IS (budget) means losing 6x potential impressions. Raising bids helps win more auctions within constrained budget but won't magically 10x traffic.
- **Luxury longtail = low volume**: Many hero keywords show "Not eligible — rarely served" status. This is normal for ultra-specific terms like "luxury handcrafted christmas wreath". They'll trigger for close variants.
## Next session priorities (Nov 18+)
1. **🚨 CHECK DATE**: If 1st of month, verify Google auto-apply settings haven't been re-enabled (happened Nov 15!)
2. **Conversion watch** (CRITICAL): Any sales? Currently 7 days without conversion (last sale Nov 11). Need sale urgently.
3. **Single keyword monitoring**: Is "stylish christmas wreaths" still serving? Performance degrading? CTR/CPC stable?
4. **Search terms review**: Any new negative keywords needed? Currently 899 negatives, 0% waste maintained.
5. **Budget utilization**: Still 91.8% optimal? Or dropping due to auction dynamics?
6. **Google Shopping exploration**: Check if Merchant Center exists, create Shopping campaign ($10/day) for additional volume.
7. **ROI tracking**: Current +13% ROI. Need 6-7 more sales to hit season target. Realistic: 4-6 sales (borderline profitable).
8. **Alternative traffic sources**: Organic (6 sessions weekend), Direct (4 sessions), Email (abandoned cart sequences?).

- Check `data/keyword-reports/` for most recent performance reports (sorted by date in filename).
- Review this file (`AI-CONTEXT.md`) for latest status and completed actions.
- Key question for user: "What date's reports do you have?" then analyze against previous baseline.

## Next session priorities (Nov 2+)
1. Review Nov 1 full-day reports — did hero keywords sustain 30% CTR? Did "high end christmas wreath" serve?
2. Check if centrepiece keywords got impressions with $4.75 bids.
3. If IS still <15-20% on hero terms after 24 hours: consider +$0.25 bid boost OR accept budget reality.
4. Monitor Search Terms 2-3x daily first week; add negatives immediately.
5. Watch GA4 for first add_to_cart signal; if 0 after 100+ clicks: flag LP review.
6. Weekend (Nov 2-3): lighter monitoring; full Week 1 review Monday Nov 4.
