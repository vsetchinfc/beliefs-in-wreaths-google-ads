# Rapid context for future sessions — Beliefs in Wreaths (Google Ads)

Last updated: 2025-11-03
Owner: vsetchinfc
Scope: Christmas Search campaign (AU) — 43 days remaining (Nov 3–Dec 15, 2025)

## TL;DR
- Running **$25/day** budget (optimized Nov 2). Hero keywords performing exceptionally: "luxury christmas wreath" (29.41% CTR), "luxury christmas decor" (25.53% CTR).
- **🚨 CRITICAL DISCOVERY (Nov 3)**: Campaign was blocking "artificial/fake/faux" searches—but that's THE PRODUCT! Sells **artificial flowers & greenery**, NOT dried/fresh.
- **Action required**: Remove 14 negative keywords blocking artificial product searches (list: `data/keyword-reports/NEGATIVE-KEYWORDS-TO-REMOVE.csv`).
- Active keywords: 6 luxury terms only (luxury wreath/wreaths/decor, bespoke/handcrafted decorations, premium decorations).
- Negative keywords: 1,119 total, but 14 blocking own product category (fake, artificial flowers, faux plants, etc.).
- Budget throttled (>90% Lost IS budget) but CTR exceptional (11.67%). Missing volume due to blocked artificial searches.
- Import files ready: wreaths, centrepieces, collection page CSVs in `data/`. Reports archived in `data/keyword-reports/`.

✅ **Artificial flowers and greenery** (faux, high-quality, luxury positioning)  
✅ Christmas wreaths made from artificial materials

- "Faux" = premium synonym for artificial (luxury positioning!)
- "Dried" = WRONG product (correctly blocked as negative) ✅
- "Fresh" = WRONG product (correctly blocked as negative) ✅

## What to do first when resuming
1. **🚨 VERIFY Nov 3 ACTION**: Check user removed 14 artificial/faux blocking negatives (fake, artificial flowers, faux plants, etc.). File: `data/keyword-reports/NEGATIVE-KEYWORDS-TO-REMOVE.csv`
2. Check Nov 4-5 reports to see if "artificial/fake/faux" search terms now appearing (expected: +20-30% impressions).
3. Monitor spend after negative removal (may temporarily increase to $35-38/day, then stabilize at $25-30).
4. Review Search Terms for new artificial product queries (validate high CTR 12-15%).
5. Verify $25/day budget optimization + negative removal achieved target (expect $25-30/day spend, 13-14 clicks).
6. **Critical**: Monitor GA4 for conversion attribution from artificial product searches.
7. If "artificial" terms still not appearing: Add explicit keywords ("artificial christmas wreaths", "faux christmas greenery", etc.).
## Completed actions

### ✅ Nov 1, 2025: Initial luxury optimization
**Paused keywords:**
- christmas table decorations (Broad) — was 235 imps, 23 clicks, $46 (wrong intent)
- christmas wreath (Broad) — was 74 imps, 8 clicks, $9.65
- [buy christmas wreath] (Exact)
- "christmas wreaths australia" (Phrase)
- "designer christmas wreaths" (Phrase)
- "christmas door wreaths" (Phrase)
- Other low/no volume terms

**Re-enabled winner:**
- "high end christmas wreath" (Phrase) — was mistakenly paused; had 20% CTR, $3.95 CPC before pause.
- Re-enabled Nov 1 morning with $5.00 bid. **Status Nov 2**: Still 0 impressions after 2 days → likely quality score issue or zero search volume.

**Bid increases (Nov 1 morning):**
- "luxury christmas wreath" (Phrase): $5.00 → **$5.50** ✅ performing (30.77% CTR)
- "luxury christmas wreaths" (Phrase): $3.50 → **$4.50** ✅ (0 imps yet)
- "luxury christmas decor" (Phrase): $4.50 → **$5.00** ✅ star performer (29.41% CTR)
- "handmade christmas wreaths" (Phrase): $2.50 → **$3.50** ✅ (7 imps, 0 clicks)
- "luxury christmas centrepieces" (Phrase): $4.50 → **$4.75** ✅ (0 imps yet)
- "luxury christmas candle holder" (Phrase): $4.25 → **$4.75** ✅ (0 imps yet)

### ✅ Nov 3, 2025: Negative keywords crisis discovery & resolution
**Critical discovery:** Campaign has 1,119 negative keywords, but **14 terms blocking artificial/faux product searches**—which is exactly what the business sells!

**Product clarity revealed:**
- Beliefs in Wreaths sells: **Artificial flowers and greenery** (NOT dried, NOT fresh)
- "Fake" = positive search term (people looking for artificial!)
- "Artificial" = core product category (not negative quality signal!)
- "Faux" = premium synonym for artificial (luxury positioning!)

**Negative keywords blocking own product (REMOVE THESE 14):**
1. `fake` (Broad) 🚨 CRITICAL — blocks "fake christmas wreaths" = YOUR CUSTOMERS!
2. `artificial flowers spotlight` (Exact)
3. `[artificial christmas tree australia]` (Exact)
4. `[cheap artificial flowers australia]` (Exact)
5. `[artificial xmas plants]` (Exact) 🚨 YOUR PRODUCT CATEGORY!
6. `[artificial flowers wholesale bulk]` (Exact)
7. `[artificial flowers wholesale liverpool]` (Exact)
8. `[artificial crocus]` (Exact)
9. `[faux indoor hanging plants]` (Exact) 🚨 FAUX = YOUR PRODUCT!
10. `[artifical fliwers]` (Exact) — misspelling
11. `[fake purple flowers]` (Exact)
12. `[artificial spruce christmas tree]` (Exact)
13. `[uv protected artificial outdoor plants]` (Exact)
14. `[ebay artificial flower arrangements]` (Exact)

**Correctly blocking (KEEP THESE):**
- ✅ All "dried" negatives (dried flower wreaths, dried wreaths, etc.) — correct, doesn't sell dried
- ✅ All "fresh" negatives (fresh wreaths, fresh flowers, etc.) — correct, doesn't sell fresh
- ✅ Competitors, DIY, lights, price modifiers — all correct

**Files created:**
- `data/keyword-reports/NEGATIVE-KEYWORDS-TO-REMOVE.csv` — 14 terms to remove + instructions
- `minutes/2025-11-03-negative-keywords-crisis.md` — Full crisis analysis (6,000+ words)

**Expected impact after removal:**
- +20-30% impression volume (access to artificial/fake/faux searches)
- +2-3 clicks/day (high-intent artificial product searchers)
- CTR maintained or improved to 12-15%
- Spend may increase to $35-38/day initially, then stabilize $25-30
- Better product-market fit (artificial searchers = exactly what you sell!)

**Why this matters:**
- No "artificial" terms in Search Terms report = they were BLOCKED!
- Missing 20-30% of addressable market (artificial product category)
- Lost IS >90% partly due to blocked category searches (not just budget!)
- Landing page needs "Premium Artificial" messaging (explains 0 ATC after 44 clicks)

- **CRITICAL ALERT**: **0 add_to_cart events** after 37 clicks / 25 sessions 🔴
  - This is NOT a targeting problem (31% CTR on hero keywords = perfect intent)
  - This IS a landing page/offer/value prop problem
  - **Action required**: Landing page audit and implement luxury homepage mockup
- Current metrics (Nov 2, 3 days): CTR **11.08%** ✅ (excellent), Avg CPC $2.94 (expected with luxury focus), Lost IS budget **89.78%** 🔴 (worse - higher bids hit cap faster).
- After Nov 2 optimization: Expect CTR 15-25% (only luxury keywords), 8-10 clicks/day, ~$25 daily spend, Lost IS budget will stay 80-85%.

## Tracking and quality gates
- GA4→Google Ads linking completed on 2025-10-29; conversions importing correctly.
- GA4 Paid Search (Oct 29-31): 47 sessions, 70.2% engagement rate, 33.5s avg time, 0 key events (purchases).
- **Alert**: 0 add_to_cart events from Paid Search after 70+ clicks total — needs monitoring. If 0 ATC after 100+ clicks = LP/value issue, not keyword issue.
- Current metrics (Nov 1): CTR 10.46% ✅ (target 8-12%), Avg CPC $2.71 ⚠️ (rising with luxury focus, expected), Lost IS budget 85% 🔴 (main blocker).
- Week 1 targets: 1-3 conversions, 8-11% CTR ✅, $3-4 CPC ⚠️ (on track), IS 20-40% 🔴 (still <10%).

## Known pitfalls and lessons learned
- **Budget throttling is the #1 issue**: 85% Lost IS (budget) means losing 6x potential impressions. Raising bids helps win more auctions within constrained budget but won't magically 10x traffic.
- **Luxury longtail = low volume**: Many hero keywords show "Not eligible — rarely served" status. This is normal for ultra-specific terms like "luxury handcrafted christmas wreath". They'll trigger for close variants.
## Next session priorities (Nov 4+)
1. **🚨 VERIFY CRITICAL FIX**: Confirm user removed 14 artificial/faux blocking negatives from Google Ads.
2. **Monitor Search Terms** (Nov 4-5): Look for "artificial", "fake", "faux" queries now appearing (expect 5-10 new terms).
3. **Check impression volume**: Baseline 94/day → expect 115-125/day (+20-30%) after negative removal.
4. **Verify spend**: May temporarily increase to $35-38/day, should stabilize at $25-30/day.
5. **CTR validation**: Should maintain or improve to 12-15% (artificial searches = high intent).
6. **If artificial terms don't appear**: Add explicit keywords ("artificial christmas wreaths" Phrase $4.00, "faux christmas greenery" Phrase $3.50).
7. **Landing page audit**: Add "Premium Artificial Christmas Wreaths" messaging prominently (explains 0 ATC after 44 clicks).
8. **GA4 conversion tracking**: Check if Nov 3 conversion (1) imported to Google Ads yet (24-48 hour delay normal).
- Read: `ACTION-PLAN.md` (updated Nov 1 with current strategy) and latest minutes file under `minutes/`.
- Check `data/keyword-reports/` for most recent performance reports (sorted by date in filename).
- Review this file (`AI-CONTEXT.md`) for latest status and completed actions.
- Key question for user: "What date's reports do you have?" then analyze against previous baseline.

## Next session priorities (Nov 2+)
1. Review Nov 1 full-day reports — did hero keywords sustain 30% CTR? Did "high end christmas wreath" serve?
2. Check if centrepiece keywords got impressions with $4.75 bids.
3. If IS still <15-20% on hero terms after 24 hours: consider +$0.25 bid boost OR accept budget reality.
4. Monitor Search Terms 2-3x daily first week; add negatives immediately.
5. Watch GA4 for first add_to_cart signal; if 0 after 100+ clicks: flag LP review.
6. Weekend (Nov 2-3): lighter monitoring; full Week 1 review Monday Nov 4.
