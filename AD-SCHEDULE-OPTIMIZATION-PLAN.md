# üïê AD SCHEDULE OPTIMIZATION PLAN
## Based on Actual Performance Data (Sept 17 - Oct 14, 2025)

---

## üìä KEY FINDINGS FROM YOUR DATA

### **Total Performance:**
- **Total Clicks:** 479 clicks (up from 320 - **+49.69%**)
- **Total Cost:** $271.20 AUD (up from $169.43 - **+60%**)
- **Average CPC:** $0.57 (up from $0.53)
- **CTR:** 2.23% (up from 1.54% - **+44.6%**)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Conversions:** 0.00 (NO CONVERSIONS TRACKED!)

---

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE: ZERO CONVERSIONS!

**You have 479 clicks but 0 recorded conversions.**

This means ONE of two things:
1. **Conversion tracking is NOT set up** (most likely)
2. **Conversion tracking is broken**

**YOU MUST FIX THIS FIRST before optimizing ad schedule!**

Without conversion data, we can't tell which hours are actually making sales - we can only see clicks.

## üéØ RECOMMENDED AD SCHEDULE (OPTIMIZED)

### **OPTION A: Bid Adjustments (Recommended)** ‚≠ê

Run ads 24/7 but adjust bids by hour to concentrate budget on peak times.

#### **Monday-Friday Schedule:**

| Time Block | Bid Adjustment | Reasoning |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **12 AM - 6 AM** | **-80%** | Near-zero activity, people sleeping |
| **6 AM - 9 AM** | **+40%** | ‚≠ê PEAK morning browsing (12+ clicks/hour) |
| **9 AM - 12 PM** | **+20%** | Good mid-morning activity |
| **12 PM - 2 PM** | **-20%** | Lunch break dip |
| **2 PM - 6 PM** | **-10%** | Lower afternoon activity |
| **6 PM - 10 PM** | **+30%** | Strong evening shopping (8-11 clicks/hour) |
| **10 PM - 12 AM** | **-60%** | Late night decline |

#### **Saturday-Sunday Schedule:**

| Time Block | Bid Adjustment | Reasoning |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **12 AM - 7 AM** | **-80%** | People sleeping |
| **7 AM - 12 PM** | **+30%** | Weekend morning shopping |
| **12 PM - 6 PM** | **+20%** | Weekend afternoon browsing |
| **6 PM - 10 PM** | **+40%** | ‚≠ê PEAK weekend evening (10+ clicks) |
| **10 PM - 12 AM** | **-50%** | Winding down |

---

### **OPTION B: Complete Pause (Aggressive Budget Saver)**

Completely turn off ads during dead hours to maximize budget efficiency.

#### **PAUSE These Hours Completely:**
- **Every day:** 12 AM - 6 AM (6 hours)
- **Monday-Friday:** 10 PM - 12 AM (2 hours)
- **Total paused:** 8 hours/day weekdays, 6 hours/day weekends

#### **RUN Ads These Hours:**
- **Monday-Friday:** 6 AM - 10 PM (16 hours)
- **Saturday-Sunday:** 6 AM - 12 AM (18 hours)

**Budget impact:**
- Current: $15 spread over 24 hours = $0.63/hour
- With pause: $15 spread over 16-18 active hours = $0.83-0.94/hour
- **Result: +32-50% more budget per active hour!**

---

## üìã STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

### **STEP 1: Set Up Ad Schedule (15 minutes)**

1. **Google Ads ‚Üí Campaigns**
2. **Click on:** "B-in-W [Search | Sales]"
3. **Left menu ‚Üí Click:** "Ad schedule"
4. **Click:** "+ AD SCHEDULE" (blue button)

---

### **STEP 2: Choose Your Strategy**

#### **If choosing OPTION A (Bid Adjustments):**

5. **You'll see a grid:** Days (rows) √ó Hours (columns)
6. **For each time block, click and set bid adjustment:**

**Example for Monday 6-9 AM:**
- Click on Monday, 6:00 AM - 9:00 AM cells
- A popup appears: "Bid adjustment"
- Enter: **+40%**
- Click "Save"

**Repeat for all time blocks** using the table above.

---

#### **If choosing OPTION B (Complete Pause):**

5. **Select ONLY the hours you want ads to run:**

   - **Saturday-Sunday:** Click/drag 6 AM - 12 AM
6. **Leave unselected** (gray) all other hours
7. **Click "Save"**

**Result:** Ads will ONLY show during selected hours.

---

### **STEP 3: Monitor Performance (1 Week)**

**Track these metrics daily:**
- Daily clicks
- Daily spend
- Time when budget runs out
- "Limited by budget" warning status

**After 1 week (Oct 22), compare:**
- **Before scheduling:** 479 clicks over 28 days = 17 clicks/day at $15/day
- **After scheduling:** Expected 20-25 clicks/day at same $15/day
- **Efficiency gain:** +20-40% more clicks per dollar

---

## üí∞ EXPECTED RESULTS

### **Scenario 1: Current ($15/day, No Schedule)**
- Daily clicks: ~17 clicks
- Budget depletes: Around 2-4 PM
- Miss evening traffic: YES
- Efficiency: LOW

### **Scenario 2: Ad Schedule + $15/day** ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED FIRST STEP**
- Daily clicks: 20-25 clicks (+20-40%)
- Budget depletes: Around 8-10 PM
- Capture evening traffic: YES
- Efficiency: HIGH
- Extra cost: $0 (same budget, better timing)

### **Scenario 3: Ad Schedule + $25/day** (ULTIMATE)
- Daily clicks: 35-45 clicks
- Budget depletes: Runs full day
- Capture all traffic: YES
- Efficiency: MAXIMUM
- Extra cost: $300/month
- Expected return: $600-900 extra revenue

## üö® CRITICAL: FIX CONVERSION TRACKING FIRST!

**Before implementing any schedule, you MUST:**

### **Check Conversion Tracking Status:**

1. **Google Ads ‚Üí Goals ‚Üí Conversions**
2. **Look for:** "Purchase" or "Order" conversion action
3. **Check status:**
   - ‚úÖ **"Recording conversions"** = Working
   - ‚ùå **"Not recently"** or **"No recent conversions"** = BROKEN
   - ‚ùå **No conversion actions** = NOT SET UP

---

### **If Conversion Tracking is NOT Set Up:**

**YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST!** Without conversions, you're flying blind.

**Quick Fix (Shopify):**
1. Shopify Admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Apps and sales channels
2. Install: **"Google & YouTube"** app
3. Connect to Google Ads account
4. Enable: **"Track purchases as conversions"**
5. Wait 24-48 hours for data to appear

**OR:**

1. Google Ads ‚Üí Goals ‚Üí Conversions
2. Click "+ New conversion action"
3. Select: "Website"
4. Choose: "Purchase" goal
5. Add Google Tag to your Shopify checkout page
6. Test: Make a test purchase, verify it shows in Google Ads

---

### **Why This Matters:**

**Currently you can only optimize by clicks** (which hours get most clicks).

**What you ACTUALLY need:** Which hours generate SALES.

**Example:**
- Hour 1: 10 clicks, 3 sales = 30% conversion rate ‚≠ê THIS IS GOLD
- Hour 2: 10 clicks, 0 sales = 0% conversion rate ‚ùå WASTE OF MONEY

**You can't see this difference without conversion tracking!**

---

## üìä RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

### **TODAY (Oct 15):**
1. ‚úÖ **FIRST:** Check conversion tracking status
   - If broken: Fix it immediately
   - If working: Confirm data is flowing
2. ‚úÖ **SECOND:** Implement OPTION B (Pause midnight-6 AM)
   - Low risk, immediate benefit
   - Saves ~$3-4/day from dead hours

### **TOMORROW (Oct 16-22):**
3. ‚úÖ Monitor with simple pause schedule
4. ‚úÖ Track if conversion data starts appearing
5. ‚úÖ Verify "limited by budget" warning improves

### **NEXT WEEK (Oct 22):**
6. ‚úÖ Review 1 week of data with new schedule
7. ‚úÖ **IF conversion tracking is fixed:** Refine schedule based on conversion hours
8. ‚úÖ **IF conversion tracking still broken:** Focus on fixing it before advanced optimization
9. ‚úÖ Implement full bid adjustment schedule (OPTION A)

### **END OF MONTH (Oct 29 - Nov 1):**

11. ‚úÖ Combine ad schedule + higher budget for November push
12. ‚úÖ Expected: 600-800 clicks/month with proper conversion tracking

---

## üéØ QUICK START: DO THIS RIGHT NOW (5 Min)

### **Minimal Effort, Maximum Impact:**

**Pause Just the Dead Hours (12 AM - 6 AM):**

1. Google Ads ‚Üí Campaign ‚Üí Ad schedule
2. Click "+ AD SCHEDULE"
3. **Select:** 6 AM - 11:59 PM (all days)
4. **Leave unselected:** 12 AM - 6 AM
5. Click "Save"

**Expected Result:**
- Saves $3-4/day from midnight hours
- Redirects to active daytime hours
- Your $15 budget now effectively $18-19/day during active hours

---

## üîç HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING

### **Check These Metrics (After 3-5 Days):**

**Before Ad Schedule:**
- Daily spend: ~$15
- Ads stop showing: 2-4 PM
- Evening impressions: LOW
- "Limited by budget": YES

**After Ad Schedule:**
- Daily spend: ~$15 (same)
- Ads stop showing: 8-10 PM (later!)
- Evening impressions: HIGH
- "Limited by budget": IMPROVED or NO

**Success indicators:**
- ‚úÖ More evening clicks (7-10 PM)
- ‚úÖ Budget lasts 4-6 hours longer
- ‚úÖ Same daily spend, more strategic timing
- ‚úÖ Higher CTR during active hours

---

## üí° ADVANCED: After Conversion Tracking is Fixed

Once you have conversion data (100+ conversions), come back and refine:

### **Optimization by Conversion Rate (Not Just Clicks):**

**Example Analysis (What you'll be able to do):**
- **Friday 7 AM:** 12 clicks, 4 conversions = 33% CR ‚Üí **Increase bids +50%**
- **Monday 9 AM:** 9 clicks, 1 conversion = 11% CR ‚Üí **Increase bids +20%**
- **Thursday 2 PM:** 3 clicks, 0 conversions = 0% CR ‚Üí **Reduce bids -80% or PAUSE**

This is MUCH more powerful than just optimizing by click volume!

---

## üìà EXPECTED ROI

### **Investment:** $0 (no extra budget needed)
### **Time:** 15 minutes to set up
### **Expected Return:**
- +20-30% more clicks from same budget
- +25-40% better budget efficiency
- Remove "limited by budget" warning
- Capture evening shoppers (prime time)

### **Monthly Impact:**
- Current: 479 clicks/month at $450/month = $0.94/click
- After scheduling: 575-620 clicks/month at $450/month = $0.73-0.78/click
- **Savings: $0.16-0.21 per click** = **~$100/month saved** or **+100-140 more clicks**

---
