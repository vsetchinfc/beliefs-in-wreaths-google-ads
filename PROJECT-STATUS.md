## üéØ Key Findings - CHRISTMAS URGENCY

   - Only 11 weeks until Christmas, 10 weeks until last orders
   - Currently invisible to Christmas shoppers (2.5 impressions/day)
   - Early October = BEST ROI period (low competition)

   - **Action:** IMMEDIATE budget increase to $40-50/day

2. **All Year Products Strategy** (‚úÖ Client Decision)
   - Client wants 100% focus on Christmas Products
   - All Year Products will stay PAUSED (resume January 2026)
   - All budget allocated to Christmas campaign Oct-Dec
   - **Action:** Confirmed - no changes needed to All Year Products

3. **No Conversion Tracking** (üî¥ Critical) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

   - **Action:** Install tracking THIS WEEK before spending increases

4. **15+ Irrelevant Keywords in Christmas Campaign** (üü° High Priority)
   - Generic gift/birthday terms waste Christmas budget
   - **Action:** Delete immediately

**Impact:** May not be safe to unpause immediately
