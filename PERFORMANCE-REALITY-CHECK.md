## üîç WHAT WENT WRONG (And How To Fix It)

### Problem #1: Budget Wasted on Wrong Keywords

**These keywords burned $243 with ZERO sales:**
- "christmas table decorations" ‚Üí $51 spent, 0 sales
- [buy christmas wreath] ‚Üí $42 spent, 0 sales
- "christmas wreath" (broad) ‚Üí $57 spent, 0 sales
- "christmas wreaths australia" ‚Üí $12 spent, 0 sales
- "designer christmas wreaths" ‚Üí $16 spent, 0 sales
- "high end christmas wreath" ‚Üí $18 spent, 0 sales
- "christmas door wreaths" ‚Üí $13 spent, 0 sales

**Fix:** Pause ALL of these immediately. Redirect $243/month to luxury keywords that work.

### Problem #2: GA4 Tracking Issues

- Google Ads shows: 1,382 clicks
- GA4 shows: 619 sessions (only 45%!)
- **763 clicks are missing from tracking**

**What this means:** You might have MORE sales than we can see! 

**Fix:** 
1. Check Shopify orders from Aug 1-Oct 30
2. Look for Google Ads referrals
3. Fix auto-tagging in Google Ads
4. Verify GA4 measurement ID on all pages

### Problem #3: Not Enough Focus on Winner

Your best keyword got only 15 impressions in 3 months (0.02% of total).

**Fix:** Increase bid from $3 to $5-6 to get MORE of this traffic!
