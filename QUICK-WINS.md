### 6. Add 5 High-Intent CHRISTMAS Keywords (PRIORITY)
**Time:** 15 minutes | **Impact:** CRITICAL

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** If exact match keywords show "Low search volume", use phrase match or broad match modifier instead.

**Add to "Christmas Products" - REVISED LIST:**
```
"buy christmas wreath australia" - Phrase Match - Bid: $1.20
"christmas wreath delivery" - Phrase Match - Bid: $1.00
+luxury +christmas +wreath - Broad Match Modifier - Bid: $0.90
"christmas door wreath" - Phrase Match - Bid: $1.00
"premium christmas wreath" - Phrase Match - Bid: $0.90
```

**Why the change:** Australia is a smaller market. Super-specific exact match keywords (like [buy christmas wreath online australia]) have low search volume. Phrase match captures the intent while allowing variations that actually get searches.

**Alternative if these also show low volume:**
```
christmas wreaths australia - Broad Match - Bid: $0.80
buy christmas wreath - Broad Match - Bid: $0.90
christmas wreath delivery sydney - Broad Match - Bid: $0.80
luxury christmas decorations - Broad Match - Bid: $0.70
designer christmas wreath - Broad Match - Bid: $0.80
```

**How:**
1. Remove the exact match keywords showing "Not eligible"
2. Add the phrase match versions above
3. Monitor search terms report closely
4. Add negatives for any irrelevant searches

**Result:** Capture purchase intent with realistic search volume
