## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Missing Christmas Sales Window ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
**Impact:** Only 11 weeks until Christmas - losing valuable shopping days

**Current Situation:**
- Peak Christmas shopping is NOW (Oct-Nov)
- Your ads are barely visible (36 impressions in 2 weeks)
- Competitors are capturing Christmas wreath searches
- Each day of inaction = lost sales

**Timeline Pressure:**
- **October:** Early Christmas shoppers, planners (CRITICAL)
- **November:** Peak Christmas shopping volume
- **Early December:** Last-minute shoppers
- **After Dec 15:** Too late for most delivery

**Recommendation:** Immediately maximize Christmas Products campaign visibility.

---

### Issue #2: Extremely Low Visibility ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Impact:** Your ads are barely showing

With only 36 impressions in 2 weeks (about 2.5 per day), your ads are essentially invisible to potential customers.

**Why This Happens:**
- Daily budget too low (appears to be $5-10/day)
- Keyword bids not competitive enough
- All Year Products paused (see Issue #1)

**Recommendation:** Increase daily budget to $20-30 minimum to gain meaningful visibility.

---

### Issue #3: No Conversion Tracking ‚ö†Ô∏è   - Verified it is working ‚úÖ
**Impact:** Cannot measure return on investment

Currently showing 0 conversions because tracking is not installed.

**Why This Matters:**
- Can't identify which keywords drive sales
- Can't calculate ROI or cost per acquisition
- Can't optimize campaign for profitability
- Can't use Google's automated bidding effectively

**Recommendation:** Install Google Ads conversion tracking on your website immediately. ‚úÖ COMPLETED

---

### Issue #4: 20+ Irrelevant Keywords
**Impact:** Wasting budget on non-wreath searches

Currently targeting keywords like:
- "gift for"
- "best present"  
- "birthday ideas for women"
- "Black Friday Sale"
- "christmas tree store"

These are not specific to wreaths and attract the wrong audience.

**Recommendation:** Remove these keywords to focus budget on wreath-specific terms.
