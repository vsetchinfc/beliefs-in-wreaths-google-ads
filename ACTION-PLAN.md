🎯 **Waste terms identified:** lights, DIY, cheap, "big w", etsy, ferrero = need negative keywords immediately

  - Hold budget at $25/day or increase to $30-35/day after mobile LP fixed?ockup (mockup/luxury-homepage-mockup.html):**

1. **Price anchoring at top (mobile hero section):**

**Need these reports to complete audience quality assessment:**

1. **State/City Location Report:**
   - Google Ads → Locations (left sidebar)

   - **Goal:** Confirm Top 10-20% earners (affluent luxury buyers)
   
3. **GA4 Landing Page + Conversions:**
   - GA4 → Reports → Engagement → Landing page

### ⚠️ What's Blocking Conversions

**1. Mobile Landing Page Experience (Priority #1):**
- 84% mobile traffic, 100% conversions from mobile
- BUT only **0.17% mobile conversion rate** (should be 1-2%)
- **10x improvement potential** by fixing mobile LP
- Issues: No price anchoring, trust signals below fold, Afterpay not visible, slow load

**2. Waste Terms (Priority #2):**
- "xmas lights" (1 click), "christmas lights" (1 click) = wrong product
- "the christmas shack slacks creek" (3 clicks, $3.49) = competitor search
- "big w christmas wreaths" (1 click, $1.20) = budget brand intent
- DIY terms: "ferrero rocher wreath", "christmas lolly wreath", "making decorations"
- **Cost:** ~$6-8/day in waste, need negative keywords immediately

**3. Geographic Blind Spot:**
- Only "Australia" shown in location report (no state/city granularity)
- Can't identify wealthy suburbs vs budget areas
- **Action needed:** Pull State/City report to optimize for Eastern Suburbs Sydney, Toorak Melbourne

**4. Unknown Demographics:**
- 484 clicks (34%) from "Unknown" age = cookie blocking
- 1 conversion from "Unknown" (0.21% conv rate)
- Lower engagement (1.52% CTR vs 2.90-3.69% for identified ages)
- **Acceptable:** Can't control, but majority (66%) identified as 45-65+ ✅

---

### 📊 Audience Quality Score: 7.5/10

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Perfect age targeting (45-65+ affluent)
- ✅ Exceptional keyword intent ("luxury" terms 50% conv rate)
- ✅ Mobile buyers identified (84% traffic, 100% conversions)
- ✅ High CTR (31-40% on luxury terms)
- ✅ Exclusions working (18-34 blocked)

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ Mobile LP not optimized (0.17% conv rate)
- ⚠️ Waste terms present (lights, DIY, competitors)
- ⚠️ No geographic targeting (wealthy suburbs)
- ⚠️ 34% "Unknown" age group
- ⚠️ Desktop not converting (111 clicks, $118, 0 conv)

**Verdict:** Targeting is excellent, but mobile landing page experience is blocking 10x potential conversions.paign-Level Negatives (Add to Campaign, not Ad Group)

### Ad-Group Level Negatives (Keep intent separated)

**For "Christmas Products" ad group pointing to WREATHS:**
```
Add these negatives:
centrepiece
centerpiece
candle
candles
holder
holders
table
tables
arrangement
arrangements
setting
place setting
```

**Create separate ad group for CENTREPIECES if not done yet:**
```
Add these negatives:
wreath
wreaths
door
"front door"
entryway
entrance
```

**Why this matters:**
- Oct 29-31: "christmas table decorations" got 235 imps, 23 clicks, $46 spend (wrong intent for wreaths)
- Need to protect wreaths budget from centrepiece searches and vice versa
- Keeps ad relevance high for Quality Score

---

## 🟢 PRIORITY 3: MONITORING & OPTIMIZATION (Ongoing)

### Search Terms Report - Check 2-3x Daily (First Week)

**When to check:** Morning (9am), Midday (1pm), Evening (6pm)

**What to look for:**
1. **Irrelevant searches** triggering ads
   - DIY/craft terms ("how to make wreath")
   - Marketplace searches ("etsy christmas wreath")
   - Wrong product category ("christmas tree", "ornaments")
   - Budget/cheap intent ("cheap wreaths", "under $50")

- Add: Search impr. share, Search lost IS (rank), Search lost IS (budget)

- ✅ Overall IS 20-40% = Sweet spot for budget-constrained campaign

**Actions based on data:**
- If hero keyword IS <10% after 2 days: +$0.25 bid
- If IS 20-40%: hold steady

---

### GA4 Engagement Tracking

**Daily check (5-10 minutes):**

1. **GA4 → Reports → Acquisition → Traffic acquisition**
   - Filter: Session primary channel = Paid Search
   - Check: Sessions, Engaged sessions, Engagement rate

2. **GA4 → Reports → Engagement → Events**
   - Filter: Event name = add_to_cart OR begin_checkout
   - Filter: Traffic source = Paid Search
   - **Critical milestone:** First add_to_cart from Paid Search
   - If 0 after 100+ clicks: LP review needed

3. **GA4 → Reports → Monetization → Ecommerce purchases**
   - Filter: First user source/medium = google / cpc
   - Track: Purchase events, Revenue
   - **Critical milestone:** First conversion (expected after 50-150 clicks at 2-5% conv rate)

**Red flags:**

- 🔴 Zero add_to_cart after 100 clicks = Value prop / price issue
- 🔴 Add_to_cart but no purchase = Checkout friction (shipping, trust)

---

**Check every Monday:**

1. Keywords tab → Columns → Quality Score
2. Add columns: Quality Score, Landing page exp, Ad relevance, Expected CTR
3. Sort by Quality Score (ascending) to find problems

- **8-10:** Excellent - maintain
- **6-7:** Good - monitor
- **4-5:** Poor - investigate and fix
- **1-3:** Bad - pause or major overhaul needed

**Common fixes:**
- Low landing page exp: Check page load speed, mobile experience

- Low expected CTR: Improve ad copy, add promotions/offers
