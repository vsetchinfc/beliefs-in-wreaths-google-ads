## 📊 UPDATED EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Nov 1, 2025)

### Current Situation (Oct 29-31 Performance)
- **Recent Performance:** 573 imps, 55 clicks, 9.60% CTR, $109.93 spend, 0 conversions
- **Critical Issue:** 🔴 **Search Lost IS (budget): 86.22%** - losing 6x impressions to budget caps
- **Impression Share:** <10% (all metrics) - barely visible in auctions
- **Days Remaining:** 45 days until Christmas cutoff (Dec 15)
- **Landing Pages:** ✅ Excellent (CTR 9.6%, 70% engagement rate confirms quality)
- **Tracking:** ✅ Working (GA4 linked, conversions importing since Oct 29)
- **Key Discovery:** Centrepieces RSA outperforming (10.7% CTR, $1.92 CPC vs wreaths 8.85%, $2.09)

### REVISED Campaign Goals (Nov 1 - Dec 15, 45 days remaining)

**✅ CURRENT BUDGET: $25-35/day** (recent reports show ~$36/day average spend)

**Campaign Strategy - UPDATED NOV 1:**
- **Focus:** 6-8 hero luxury keywords only (budget too constrained for broad discovery)
- **Key Winners:** "luxury christmas wreath" (10% CTR, $5.25 CPC), "luxury christmas decor" (50% CTR!), "handmade christmas wreaths" (5.88% CTR)
- **Surprise Star:** Centrepieces outperforming wreaths (10.7% CTR, $1.92 CPC) - less competitive niche
- **Pause:** All generic broad terms EXCEPT optionally "christmas wreath australia" with strict negatives (cap bid $1.50-1.80)
- **Critical Fix:** Raise bids on luxury terms by $0.25-0.75 to compete (currently losing 86% impressions to budget)
- **Expected Sales:** 12-18 Christmas products (wreaths + centrepieces)
- **Expected Revenue:** $2,220-3,330
- **Expected ROAS:** 200-300% (2-3:1) - conservative given budget constraints

**Success Requirements:**
✅ Conversion tracking verified and working (completed Oct 29)
✅ GA4 linked to Google Ads (completed Oct 29)
✅ Landing pages optimized (9.6% CTR confirms quality)
✅ Focus on luxury positioning only
✅ Daily monitoring - especially Search Terms for negative adds
✅ Bid increases on hero terms to win auctions (86% Lost IS must improve)

### NEW Strategy (Based on Oct 29-31 Analysis)
🎯 **Budget throttling is the #1 issue** - 86% Lost IS (budget), <10% overall IS
🎯 **Hero keywords (6-8 only):** luxury wreath, luxury wreaths, handmade wreaths, luxury decor, luxury centrepieces, luxury candle holder
🎯 **Re-enable winner:** "high end christmas wreath" (20% CTR, $3.95 CPC - was mistakenly paused!)
🎯 **Raise bids immediately:** luxury terms need $4.50-5.75 range to win auctions
🎯 **Centrepieces opportunity:** 10.7% CTR at $1.92 CPC - less competitive than wreaths, consider 40% budget allocation
🎯 **Generic broad paused:** ✅ "christmas table decorations" (23 clicks, $46, 0 conv) and "christmas wreath" (8 clicks, $9.65, 0 conv) already paused
🎯 **Ad-group negatives critical:** Wreaths triggering for table searches (add: centrepiece, candle, table, holder)
🎯 **Daily Search Terms review:** 2-3x/day for first week to catch waste immediately

**How to add (Option A - Fastest):**
1. Keywords tab → Negative keywords (left menu)
2. Click blue "+" button
3. Select "Campaign" level
4. Paste entire list above
5. Save

---

### Ad-Group Level Negatives (Keep intent separated)

**For "Christmas Products" ad group pointing to WREATHS:**
```
Add these negatives:
centrepiece
centerpiece
candle
candles
holder
holders
table
tables
arrangement
arrangements
setting
place setting
```

**Create separate ad group for CENTREPIECES if not done yet:**
```
Add these negatives:
wreath
wreaths
door
"front door"
entryway
entrance
```

**Why this matters:**
- Oct 29-31: "christmas table decorations" got 235 imps, 23 clicks, $46 spend (wrong intent for wreaths)
- Need to protect wreaths budget from centrepiece searches and vice versa
- Keeps ad relevance high for Quality Score

---

## 🟢 PRIORITY 3: MONITORING & OPTIMIZATION (Ongoing)

### Search Terms Report - Check 2-3x Daily (First Week)

**When to check:** Morning (9am), Midday (1pm), Evening (6pm)

**What to look for:**
1. **Irrelevant searches** triggering ads
   - DIY/craft terms ("how to make wreath")
   - Marketplace searches ("etsy christmas wreath")
   - Wrong product category ("christmas tree", "ornaments")
   - Budget/cheap intent ("cheap wreaths", "under $50")
   
2. **Geographic leakage** (if any)
   - Searches from regions you're not targeting
   - Suburb names appearing (add as negatives if not converting)
   
3. **Good searches to note**
   - High-intent queries getting clicks
   - New luxury variations to potentially add as keywords
   - Seasonal trending terms

**How to check:**
1. Keywords tab → Search terms (top)
2. Date range: Last 7 days
3. Sort by Clicks (descending)
4. Add negatives immediately for wasteful terms
5. Export weekly for documentation

---

### Impression Share Monitoring

**Goal:** Lift from <10% to 20-40% within 3-5 days after bid increases

**Check daily at:**
- Keywords tab → Columns → Modify columns → Competitive metrics
- Add: Search impr. share, Search lost IS (rank), Search lost IS (budget)

**Red flags:**
- 🔴 Lost IS (budget) still >70% = Need budget increase OR pause more keywords
- 🔴 Lost IS (rank) >30% = Bids still too low, increase by $0.25
- ✅ Overall IS 20-40% = Sweet spot for budget-constrained campaign

**Actions based on data:**
- If hero keyword IS <10% after 2 days: +$0.25 bid
- If IS 20-40%: hold steady
- If IS >60%: consider lowering bid slightly (may be overpaying)

---

### GA4 Engagement Tracking

**Daily check (5-10 minutes):**

1. **GA4 → Reports → Acquisition → Traffic acquisition**
   - Filter: Session primary channel = Paid Search
   - Check: Sessions, Engaged sessions, Engagement rate
   - Goal: Maintain 60-70%+ engagement rate

2. **GA4 → Reports → Engagement → Events**
   - Filter: Event name = add_to_cart OR begin_checkout
   - Filter: Traffic source = Paid Search
   - **Critical milestone:** First add_to_cart from Paid Search
   - If 0 after 100+ clicks: LP review needed

3. **GA4 → Reports → Monetization → Ecommerce purchases**
   - Filter: First user source/medium = google / cpc
   - Track: Purchase events, Revenue
   - **Critical milestone:** First conversion (expected after 50-150 clicks at 2-5% conv rate)

**Red flags:**
- 🔴 Engagement rate drops below 50% = Ad/LP mismatch
- 🔴 Zero add_to_cart after 100 clicks = Value prop / price issue
- 🔴 Add_to_cart but no purchase = Checkout friction (shipping, trust)

---

### Quality Score Monitoring (Weekly)

**Check every Monday:**

1. Keywords tab → Columns → Quality Score
2. Add columns: Quality Score, Landing page exp, Ad relevance, Expected CTR
3. Sort by Quality Score (ascending) to find problems

**Quality Score guide:**
- **8-10:** Excellent - maintain
- **6-7:** Good - monitor
- **4-5:** Poor - investigate and fix
- **1-3:** Bad - pause or major overhaul needed

**Common fixes:**
- Low landing page exp: Check page load speed, mobile experience
- Low ad relevance: Add keywords to ad headlines, tighten match types
- Low expected CTR: Improve ad copy, add promotions/offers

## 🎄 EFFICIENCY TIPS FOR BUDGET-CONSTRAINED CAMPAIGNS

### Maximize Impact with $25-35/Day

**1. Be Ruthless with Keywords**
- Only keep keywords with proven CTR >7%
- Pause after 50 clicks if 0 conversions AND 0 add_to_cart
- Quality over quantity - 6-8 hero keywords better than 50 mediocre ones
- "Not eligible" luxury terms OK to keep (catch longtail searches)

**2. Use Negative Keywords Aggressively**
- Add 30-50 negatives in first week
- Review Search Terms 2-3x daily first week, then daily
- Block: DIY, cheap, free, marketplaces (etsy/amazon), funeral/sympathy
- Ad-group negatives critical (wreaths ≠ centrepieces)

**3. Focus on High-Intent Only**
- Luxury/premium/handcrafted modifiers = best
- Generic broad = pause (unless "christmas wreath australia" with strict negatives)
- Geographic + product = good
- Avoid: informational ("ideas"), DIY, price-focused

**4. Monitor Impression Share Daily**
- Target: 20-40% IS (realistic for budget)
- If <10%: raise bids $0.25
- If >60%: may be overpaying (test lowering $0.25)
- Lost IS (budget) 50-70% = acceptable with constraints

**5. Separate Wreaths from Centrepieces**
- Different ad groups OR strong ad-group negatives
- Centrepieces showing 10.7% CTR, $1.92 CPC (less competitive!)
- Consider 40% budget to centrepieces if trend continues
- Prevents wrong-intent clicks (table shoppers ≠ door wreath buyers)

**6. GA4 Micro-Conversions Matter**
- Track add_to_cart and begin_checkout separately
- Zero ATC after 100 clicks = LP/value issue (not keyword problem)
- 70% engagement rate = good (audience quality confirmed)
- 33s avg engagement = visitors are browsing (positive signal)

**7. Time-Based Optimization (Week 2+)**
- After 7-10 days, check hour-of-day performance
- Add bid adjustments +15-20% for peak hours
- Consider -30% for 12am-6am if no conversions overnight
- Weekends may perform differently (browsing vs buying)
