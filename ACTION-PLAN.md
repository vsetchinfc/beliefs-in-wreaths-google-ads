## 📊 CURRENT STRATEGY - $30/DAY DUAL KEYWORD FOCUS (Nov 12, 2025)

### Active Keywords (2 Proven Converters)

**1. "stylish christmas wreaths" (Phrase Match) - $7.00 bid**
- Monday Nov 10 converter: $185 sale
- Performance: 71 imps, 13 clicks, 15.38% conv rate
- Status: ACTIVE - Primary keyword

**2. "luxury christmas decor" (Phrase Match) - $6.00 bid**
- Tuesday Nov 11 converter: $285 sale
- Performance: 13 imps, 2 clicks (after re-enabling)
- Customer journey: 2-day consideration window
- Status: ACTIVE - Secondary keyword
- **Bid raised:** $4.50 → $6.00 (Nov 12 evening - to increase impression share)
- **Current bid:** $7.00
- **Monday performance:** 71 imps, 13 clicks, 18.31% CTR, 15.38% conv rate
- **Cost per conversion:** $25.49
- **Actual CPA for 1 sale:** $82.32 (includes weekend testing spend)
- **Revenue per sale:** $185 average
- **Profit margin:** 55% ($102.68 profit on Monday)
- **Status:** ✅ KEEP ACTIVE - Only keyword that converts

### Device Bid Adjustments (Optimized Nov 11)
- **Mobile:** +20% (100% of conversions from mobile devices)
- **Desktop:** -70% (0 conversions, minimize waste)
- **Tablet:** -70% (0 conversions, $8.40 wasted Tuesday)
- **Result:** 73%+ of budget now goes to mobile (converting device)

### Budget Allocation Strategy ($30/day)

**Split between 2 proven keywords:**
- "stylish christmas wreaths" ($7.00 bid) - Primary, ~60-70% of budget
- "luxury christmas decor" ($4.50 bid) - Secondary, ~30-40% of budget

**Expected Daily Performance:**
- 25-35 impressions/day (limited volume)
- 5-7 clicks/day
- $30 daily spend (consistent)
- 1 sale every 2-3 days target

**34-Day Projection (Nov 12 - Dec 15):**
- Total budget: $1,020 (34 days × $30)
- Target sales: 10-12 conversions
- Expected revenue: $2,000-2,400 (10-12 × $200 avg)
- Projected profit: $1,000-1,400 after ad spend
- Required: 1 sale every 2.8-3.4 days to hit goal

### Paused Keywords (Low Volume/Not Converting)
- ❌ "luxury christmas wreath" (singular) - $4.50 - 0 impressions Tuesday, PAUSED
- ❌ "luxury christmas wreaths" (plural) - $4.50 - 0 impressions Tuesday, PAUSED
- ❌ All other previously tested keywords with 0 conversions

**Reasoning:** Focus budget on 2 proven converters only. Eliminate keywords with insufficient search volume or poor performance.

### Negative Keywords Added (Nov 10-11)

**Initial List (39 keywords):**
✅ Brands: morgan, finch, "morgan and finch", "royal albert", "robert gordon", aldi, habitania, "jolly and joy", "the inge glas", "royal doulton", wedgwood, wohlers, martha, "martha stewart"
✅ Wrong products: bauble, baubles, light, lights, lit, illuminated, lantern, lanterns
✅ Wrong style: nightmare, gothic, paper, coastal
✅ Wrong audience: dachshund, pet, dog, cat
✅ Wrong size/location: native, natives, mini, small, giant, 60cm, outdoor, outdoors, uk, traditional, "lands end", blue

**Additional Exact Match Negatives (Nov 11 Evening - Block Waste):**
✅ [christmas door wreath], [door wreath], [christmas reef], [christmas reefs]
✅ [xmas wreath], [xmas wreaths]
✅ [white christmas wreath], [pink christmas wreath], [grinch wreath]
✅ [christmas wreath for fireplace], [bradford exchange christmas]

**Why Exact Match:** Prevents blocking our own phrase match keywords while stopping specific waste searches.

### 🟡 PRIORITY 4: MONITOR PERFORMANCE (Daily - First Week)

**Every morning (first 7 days):**

- [ ] **Daily spend check:**
  - Goal: $25-30/day (not exceeding $35)
  - If over $35: Lower "stylish christmas wreaths" bid by $0.50
  
- [ ] **"stylish christmas wreaths" performance:**
  - Getting impressions? (expect 60-80/day)
  - Getting clicks? (expect 5-7/day at 18% CTR)
  - CTR maintaining 15-20%?
  
- [ ] **Search Terms review:**
  - Any waste terms appearing? (misspellings, wrong intent)
  - Add negatives immediately if needed
  - Confirm "christmas reef" (misspelling) still converting
  
- [ ] **Conversion tracking:**
  - Any new conversions in Google Ads?
  - GA4 showing add_to_cart events?
  - Shopify orders matching Google Ads data?

**Red flags:**
- 🔴 Daily spend over $40 = Lower bid immediately
- 🔴 Zero impressions on hero keyword = Budget depleted or bid too low
- 🔴 CTR drops below 10% = Waste terms or ad fatigue
- 🔴 3+ days with no conversions = May need to test other keywords

---

### � PRIORITY 5: WEEKEND STRATEGY (Nov 16-17)

**After running single-keyword strategy for 5-7 days:**

- [ ] **Performance review (Nov 15-16):**
  - Total spend for week (goal: $180-210 for 6 days)
  - "stylish christmas wreaths" CTR still 15-20%?
  - Conversions achieved (goal: 1-2 sales)
  - Profitability check (revenue vs spend)
  
- [ ] **Decision point:**
  - If profitable (1+ sales/week): Continue at $30/day
  - If breaking even: Hold at $30/day, monitor another week
  - If losing money (0 sales): Consider pausing or lowering to $20/day
  - If very profitable (3+ sales/week): Consider increasing to $40/day

- [ ] **Potential optimizations:**
  - Test adding back "luxury christmas wreath" at $4.50 (singular, had historical conversions)
  - Test new ad copy variations for "stylish christmas wreaths"
  - Add "christmas reef" as exact match keyword (misspelling converted)
  - Consider time-of-day bid adjustments based on Monday performance

---

### 🗓️ CHRISTMAS COUNTDOWN STRATEGY (Nov 17 - Dec 15)

**Timeline:** 28 days remaining after Nov 17

**Scaling scenarios:**

**If hitting 1 sale every 2-3 days ($30/day):**
- Week 3 (Nov 17-23): Continue $30/day, expect 2-3 sales
- Week 4 (Nov 24-30): Increase to $40/day, expect 4-5 sales
- Week 5 (Dec 1-7): Increase to $50/day, expect 5-6 sales
- Final week (Dec 8-15): Push to $60/day, expect 6-8 sales
- **Total Christmas sales:** 17-22 sales = $3,145-4,070 revenue

**If barely breaking even ($30/day):**
- Hold at $30/day entire period
- Focus on improving conversion rate through LP optimization
- Expected: 12-15 sales = $2,220-2,775 revenue

**If not profitable:**
- Reduce to $20/day or pause campaign
- Focus resources elsewhere (organic social, email marketing)

**Budget caps:**
- Maximum sustainable: $50/day (only if consistently profitable)
- Conservative: $30/day (current plan)
- Survival mode: $20/day or pause

### ⚠️ What's Blocking Conversions

**1. Mobile Landing Page Experience (Priority #1):**
- 84% mobile traffic, 100% conversions from mobile
- BUT only **0.17% mobile conversion rate** (should be 1-2%)
- **10x improvement potential** by fixing mobile LP
- Issues: No price anchoring, trust signals below fold, Afterpay not visible, slow load

**2. Waste Terms (Priority #2):**
- "xmas lights" (1 click), "christmas lights" (1 click) = wrong product
- "the christmas shack slacks creek" (3 clicks, $3.49) = competitor search
- "big w christmas wreaths" (1 click, $1.20) = budget brand intent
- DIY terms: "ferrero rocher wreath", "christmas lolly wreath", "making decorations"
- **Cost:** ~$6-8/day in waste, need negative keywords immediately

**3. Geographic Blind Spot:**
- Only "Australia" shown in location report (no state/city granularity)
- Can't identify wealthy suburbs vs budget areas
- **Action needed:** Pull State/City report to optimize for Eastern Suburbs Sydney, Toorak Melbourne

**4. Unknown Demographics:**
- 484 clicks (34%) from "Unknown" age = cookie blocking
- 1 conversion from "Unknown" (0.21% conv rate)
- Lower engagement (1.52% CTR vs 2.90-3.69% for identified ages)
- **Acceptable:** Can't control, but majority (66%) identified as 45-65+ ✅

---

### 📊 Audience Quality Score: 7.5/10

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Perfect age targeting (45-65+ affluent)
- ✅ Exceptional keyword intent ("luxury" terms 50% conv rate)
- ✅ Mobile buyers identified (84% traffic, 100% conversions)
- ✅ High CTR (31-40% on luxury terms)
- ✅ Exclusions working (18-34 blocked)

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ Mobile LP not optimized (0.17% conv rate)
- ⚠️ Waste terms present (lights, DIY, competitors)
- ⚠️ No geographic targeting (wealthy suburbs)
- ⚠️ 34% "Unknown" age group
- ⚠️ Desktop not converting (111 clicks, $118, 0 conv)

**Verdict:** Targeting is excellent, but mobile landing page experience is blocking 10x potential conversions.paign-Level Negatives (Add to Campaign, not Ad Group)

### Ad-Group Level Negatives (Keep intent separated)

**For "Christmas Products" ad group pointing to WREATHS:**
```
Add these negatives:
centrepiece
centerpiece
candle
candles
holder
holders
table
tables
arrangement
arrangements
setting
place setting
```

**Create separate ad group for CENTREPIECES if not done yet:**
```
Add these negatives:
wreath
wreaths
door
"front door"
entryway
entrance
```

**Why this matters:**
- Oct 29-31: "christmas table decorations" got 235 imps, 23 clicks, $46 spend (wrong intent for wreaths)
- Need to protect wreaths budget from centrepiece searches and vice versa
- Keeps ad relevance high for Quality Score

---

## 🟢 PRIORITY 3: MONITORING & OPTIMIZATION (Ongoing)

### Search Terms Report - Check 2-3x Daily (First Week)

**When to check:** Morning (9am), Midday (1pm), Evening (6pm)

**What to look for:**
1. **Irrelevant searches** triggering ads
   - DIY/craft terms ("how to make wreath")
   - Marketplace searches ("etsy christmas wreath")
   - Wrong product category ("christmas tree", "ornaments")
   - Budget/cheap intent ("cheap wreaths", "under $50")

| **ROAS** | 225% | **200-300%** | **200-300%** |

**Key Changes from Previous Strategy:**
- Single keyword focus ("stylish christmas wreaths" only)
- Budget reduced from $84 to $30/day (64% reduction)
- Mobile bid adjustment +20% (100% conversions from mobile)
- All non-converting keywords paused
- Expected: 1 sale every 2-3 days = 10-15 sales before Christmas

---

### Impression Share Monitoring

**Goal:** Lift from <10% to 20-40% within 3-5 days after bid increases

**Check daily at:**
- Keywords tab → Columns → Modify columns → Competitive metrics
- Add: Search impr. share, Search lost IS (rank), Search lost IS (budget)

**Red flags:**
- 🔴 Lost IS (budget) still >70% = Need budget increase OR pause more keywords
- 🔴 Lost IS (rank) >30% = Bids still too low, increase by $0.25
- ✅ Overall IS 20-40% = Sweet spot for budget-constrained campaign

**Actions based on data:**
- If hero keyword IS <10% after 2 days: +$0.25 bid
- If IS 20-40%: hold steady
- If IS >60%: consider lowering bid slightly (may be overpaying)

---

### GA4 Engagement Tracking

**Daily check (5-10 minutes):**

1. **GA4 → Reports → Acquisition → Traffic acquisition**
   - Filter: Session primary channel = Paid Search
   - Check: Sessions, Engaged sessions, Engagement rate
   - Goal: Maintain 60-70%+ engagement rate

2. **GA4 → Reports → Engagement → Events**
   - Filter: Event name = add_to_cart OR begin_checkout
   - Filter: Traffic source = Paid Search
   - **Critical milestone:** First add_to_cart from Paid Search
   - If 0 after 100+ clicks: LP review needed

3. **GA4 → Reports → Monetization → Ecommerce purchases**
   - Filter: First user source/medium = google / cpc
   - Track: Purchase events, Revenue
   - **Critical milestone:** First conversion (expected after 50-150 clicks at 2-5% conv rate)

**Red flags:**
- 🔴 Engagement rate drops below 50% = Ad/LP mismatch
- 🔴 Zero add_to_cart after 100 clicks = Value prop / price issue
- 🔴 Add_to_cart but no purchase = Checkout friction (shipping, trust)

---

### Quality Score Monitoring (Weekly)

**Check every Monday:**

1. Keywords tab → Columns → Quality Score
2. Add columns: Quality Score, Landing page exp, Ad relevance, Expected CTR
3. Sort by Quality Score (ascending) to find problems

**Quality Score guide:**
- **8-10:** Excellent - maintain
- **6-7:** Good - monitor
- **4-5:** Poor - investigate and fix
- **1-3:** Bad - pause or major overhaul needed

**Common fixes:**
- Low landing page exp: Check page load speed, mobile experience
- Low ad relevance: Add keywords to ad headlines, tighten match types
- Low expected CTR: Improve ad copy, add promotions/offers
