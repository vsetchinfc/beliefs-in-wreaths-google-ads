✅ **Focused Strategy** - 15 keywords, not 86  
✅ **Proven Performers** - Scaling what already works (40% CTR!)  
✅ **Conservative Bids** - $0.60-$1.20 range, not overpaying  
✅ **Daily Monitoring** - Catching issues fast  
✅ **Efficiency Focus** - Every dollar optimized  

### Success Requirements:

⚠️ **Conversion tracking** - Must install Week 1  
⚠️ **Daily checks** - 5-10 min monitoring  
⚠️ **Weekly optimization** - Search terms + bids  
⚠️ **Discipline** - Stay focused on 15 keywords  

**This is a realistic, achievable Christmas campaign!** 🎄
