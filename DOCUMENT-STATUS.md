## üìù NOTES FOR FUTURE

If client changes mind and approves budget increase:
- Refer to FINAL-BUDGET-DECISION.md for comparison
- Can increase to $20/day and expect 70-90 sales
- Would add $355 investment for ~$2,500-3,000 additional revenue

For now: **Execute efficiently with $15/day budget** üéØ
